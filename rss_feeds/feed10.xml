<p>The physical simplicity of the third-generation Eve Light Switch had me thinking it would be a breeze to put into my wall. Alas, looks can be deceiving. This device so difficult to install that I find it hard to recommend. And that&rsquo;s unfortunate, because there are a lot of other things to like about this smart switch (this is <em>not </em>a dimmer).</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the hardware first, since that&rsquo;s where my biggest objections come into play. The Eve Light Switch looks amazing. It&rsquo;s a simple button-style switch with no additional controls to complicate its clean design, save for a small light near the top. This feature glows when the load the switch controls is powered, but you can reverse its function to make the switch easier to find in the dark. You can also set the LED&rsquo;s brightness to one of three levels, or you can disable it altogether.</p>



<p><em>This review is part of TechHive&rsquo;s in-depth coverage of the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/578754/best-smart-switches-and-dimmers.html">best smart dimmers and switches</a>.</em></p>



<p>Flip the switch around, however, and simplicity goes out the window. The Eve Light Switch can be used as either a single-pole or 3-way switch, and all its wiring connections are done via pigtails. You&rsquo;ll need to have a neutral wire in the box, but unlike most of the competition, you <em>won&rsquo;t</em> need special companion switches at the second and subsequent locations if you&rsquo;re doing a 3-way installation.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Installing-Eve-Light-Switch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Eve Light Switch during installation" class="wp-image-1471909" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Installing-Eve-Light-Switch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Installing-Eve-Light-Switch.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Installing-Eve-Light-Switch.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Installing-Eve-Light-Switch.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Installing-Eve-Light-Switch.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Installing-Eve-Light-Switch.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Installing-Eve-Light-Switch.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" loading="lazy" /><figcaption><p>The Eve Light Switch is very large and we had difficulty shoving it and its five pigtail wires and corresponding wire nuts back into the electrical box in the wall.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Christopher Null/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Five of the switch&rsquo;s pigtails emerge from the back of the switch (line/load, neutral, ground, and two traveler wires), and you&rsquo;ll need to provide your own wire nuts to make the connections in your receptacle; none are included in the box. All those wire nuts take up a ton of space in the electrical box in the wall, which is trouble enough until you realize how massive the backside of the Eve Light Switch itself is.</p>



<p>I spent more than 30 minutes&mdash;and made a huge mess of my drywall&mdash;wedging the Eve Light Switch into place after I&rsquo;d wired it up. It never quite fit (despite being in a three-gang electrical box, which has a little extra room to offer) and it still juts out from the wall on one corner.</p>



<p>Another small (but annoying) hardware issue is that the jackets wrapped around the pigtails aren&rsquo;t stripped down far enough to accommodate larger wire nuts (they&rsquo;re acceptable if you&rsquo;re tying just two wires together). That means even more work removing insulation that could easily have been taken care of during manufacturing.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eve-smart-switch-app.png?w=1200" alt="Eve Light Switch app screenshots" class="wp-image-1471913" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eve-smart-switch-app.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3801w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eve-smart-switch-app.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eve-smart-switch-app.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eve-smart-switch-app.png?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eve-smart-switch-app.png?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eve-smart-switch-app.png?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eve-smart-switch-app.png?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Eve-smart-switch-app.png?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption><p>The Eve app is excellent and offers easy scheduling and on/off tracking.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Christopher Null/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Once physically installed, the switch set up quickly, with out-of-the-box support for Apple HomeKit, Bluetooth, and Thread. The switch can also work as a Thread node if you have a Thread border router (e.g., an Apple HomePod mini or a newer Apple TV 4K), but as of the date of this review, it is not listed in the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://csa-iot.org/csa-iot_products/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1471914-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">CSA&rsquo;s database of Matter Certified products</a>. Scan the HomeKit QR code and the device appears within the Apple Home and Eve apps within seconds.</p>



<p>I did most of my testing within the more robust Eve app, which lets you assign the switch to a room, set up scheduling, and track usage over the last 24 hours (on/off time only, it doesn&rsquo;t track power consumption). An automation system lets you tie multiple devices together, even different brands, as long as they support HomeKit. The Eve app isn&rsquo;t the most intuitive for <em>all</em> these purposes, but it&rsquo;s easy enough to master with a little patience. The scheduling system is particularly powerful and flexible, and since remote connections don&rsquo;t depend on a server in the cloud, usage activity is completely private.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I had some trouble with the app losing its connection to the switch, although its location in the garage meant there was a bit of distance (and interference) between it and the Apple TV 4K serving as a Thread border router. On the other hand, a Kasa Smart Wi-Fi switch I&rsquo;d installed just a few feet away from the Eve switch has had none of the same connectivity troubles. The upshot is that using the app often meant long, frustrating delays while it attempted to reconnect to the Thread network, although to Eve&rsquo;s credit, it always did, eventually.</p>



<p>The Eve Light Switch is sophisticated and pretty, and users who are ready to jump face-first into the Thread universe might find it appealing, especially if they want to build out a multi-vendor network of Thread devices. While the disconnects are forgivable, the hulking, bulky hardware is considerably less so as we approach 2023, when things should be shrinking in size, not going the other direction.</p>

<p>No smart lighting solution is as elegant as having smart light switches and dimmers embedded in your walls. Sure, you could screw smart bulbs into your fixtures, or plug a couple of lamps into smart plugs and call it a day, but if the light fixture in question is controlled by a dumb switch, you&rsquo;ll never be able to control that smart bulb if the switch is in the off position.</p>



<p>While they can be a pain to install&mdash;hire an electrician if you&rsquo;re not comfortable doing it yourself&mdash;once it&rsquo;s installed, a smart light switch lets you turn your lights on and off according to a schedule, with a smartphone app, and&mdash;with the installation of accessories&mdash;in response to voice commands, motion, or even your location (provided you have your smartphone with you).</p>



<p>Here are our top picks in smart dimmers, followed by a guide to the features and terminology you&rsquo;ll encounter when you shop for one. </p>

<p>The Lutron Cas&eacute;ta ecosystem, of which the Diva Smart Dimmer is a part of, is much less open than the other big three smart lighting platforms: Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, and Zigbee, and we&rsquo;ve not yet learned what plans Lutron has for the new Matter smart home standard (althought Lutron is a member of the Connectivity Standards Alliance that defined Matter). But in the grand scheme of things, we don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s a reason to avoid Lutron&rsquo;s smart lighting products. Cas&eacute;ta is so inclusive of third-party smart home products&ndash;Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, IFTTT, Samsung SmartThings, and even Sonos speakers&ndash;that there&rsquo;s little reason for concern that buyers will end up on a disconnected island. The Diva Smart Dimmer itself is an excellent product and we highly recommend it.</p>

<p>TP-Link&rsquo;s motion-activated Kasa Smart Wi-Fi dimmer gives you immense control over how its motion- and light-sensing features work. Why reach for a light switch when you can have the switch turn on the light as you approach? And TP-Link&rsquo;s dimmer is remarkably low priced&ndash;it was selling for $30 at the time of our review ($10 less than its $40 list price). It&rsquo;s remarkably easy to install, but it does require a neutral wire, which will be a non-starter for some homeowners. </p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the prettiest dimmer on the market, but GE Lighting&rsquo;s Cync Dimmer + Motion Sensor Switch sure packs the features. And if you happen to own GE Lighting&rsquo;s Cync smart bulbs, the switch can also control them even if they&rsquo;re not wired to the dimmer. Being a Wi-Fi&nbsp;device, this dimmer switch doesn&rsquo;t require the presence of a smart home hub or any other bridge to your home network. An onboard motion sensor can turn the light switch on when the room is occupied, and an ambient light sensor will stop that from happening if there&rsquo;s enough daylight that the extra light isn&rsquo;t needed.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s now also&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B082LK4X4X?ots=1&amp;slotNum=2&amp;imprToken=bec1f6ef-36d1-be5f-1aa&amp;tag=techhivecom-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.techhive.com/article/578754/best-smart-switches-and-dimmers.html" target="_blank">a 3-wire version of this product</a>&nbsp;that doesn&rsquo;t require a neutral wire</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve settled on Zigbee as your smart lighting protocol of choice&mdash;and it&rsquo;s certainly not a bad one if you have a SmartThings hub, an Amazon Echo with an integrated smart home hub, or the like&ndash;allow us to recommend Jasco&rsquo;s Enbrighten Zigbee In-Wall Smart Dimmer. It not only has a slimline design that isn&rsquo;t tough to shove back into the box when you install it, it has enough onboard intelligence to distinguish the line wire from the load wire, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about mixing them up if you&rsquo;re doing the work for yourself. This smart dimmer is affordably priced, too</p>

<p>Putting this roundup together exposed a hole in our editorial coverage. I&rsquo;ve had Leviton&rsquo;s Decora Smart Z-Wave switches and dimmers (along with other brands of Z-Wave switches) installed in the smart home I built the house in 2007), but we&rsquo;ve never officially reviewed them. That said, Leviton&rsquo;s Z-Wave lighting controls are among my favorites; so, while TechHive hasn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>officially</em>&nbsp;reviewed Leviton&rsquo;s product, I have deep personal experience with it and recommend it strongly. All that said, if Matter succeeds in becoming the de facto smart home standard, you&rsquo;ll need a Z-Wave-to-Matter bridge, and none have been announced yet. </p>

<h2 id="smart-dimmer-shopping-tips">Smart dimmer shopping tips</h2>



<p>You&rsquo;ll need to make a raft of decisions before you choose which smart switches to install in your home, and your choices will be influenced by everything from the type of wiring in your walls to what flavor of smart home system you have now or plan to install later. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know in roughly the order you&rsquo;ll need to decide.</p>



<p><strong>Neutral wire requirement</strong>: The vast majority of smart switches and dimmers require the presence of a neutral wire&mdash;in addition to line (power from the circuit-breaker panel), load (power to the light to be controlled), and ground wires&mdash;in the electrical box inside the wall. Smart switches have radios that must be constantly powered, and the neutral wire is usually what supplies that juice. While all homes have neutral wires, many older homes don&rsquo;t have a neutral wire in every box. If you&rsquo;re not sure if there&rsquo;s a neutral wire at the location you want to install a smart switch, we have <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3433176/how-to-install-a-smart-switch.html">a how-to story here</a> that will help you figure it out. If you <em>don&rsquo;t </em>have a neutral wire, <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3263654/lutron-caseta-smart-lighting-dimmer-switch-starter-kit-review.html">Lutron&rsquo;s Cas&eacute;ta smart dimmer</a> and the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/583691/c-by-ge-c-start-smart-switch-motion-sensing-dimmer-review.html">GE Cync Dimmer (3-wire version)</a> are among the few that do <em>not</em> require one.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/01/c_by_ge_smart_switch_without_neutral_wiring-100826347-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578754-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/01/c_by_ge_smart_switch_without_neutral_wiring-100826347-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="c by ge smart switch without neutral wiring" loading="lazy" /></a><figcaption> <p>Most smart switches depend on the presence of a neutral wire to supply energy to their radios, but many homes built prior to the 1980s don&rsquo;t have a neutral wire in every box. <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3512824/c-by-ge-hubless-no-neutral-wire-required-smart-switch-how-did-they-do-it.html">GE Cync</a> and <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3263654/lutron-caseta-smart-lighting-dimmer-switch-starter-kit-review.html">Lutron Cas&eacute;ta</a> are among the few smart switches that don&rsquo;t depend a neutral wire.</p> </figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Single- or multi-pole</strong>: If the light you wish to control is connected to just one switch, then you&rsquo;ll need to replace it with a single-pole smart switch. If more than one switch controls that load&mdash;switches on opposite sides of a room, for example&mdash;then you&rsquo;ll need to replace it with a multi-pole smart switch. This typically means that you&rsquo;ll <em>also</em> need to buy a companion switch or switches for the other end(s) of the circuit. There are a few exceptions to this rule, so check the documentation accompanying whichever smart switch you decide to buy before you install it.</p>



<p><strong>Control protocol</strong>: You&rsquo;ll undoubtedly want to control your smart lighting with your smartphone or tablet, and most people will also want to turn lights on and off with voice commands spoken to a smart speaker, such as an Amazon Echo or a Google Home. But to do that, the smart switch you buy must have some way of connecting to your home network (which explains why Bluetooth smart switches can&rsquo;t talk to smart speakers).</p>



<p>Some smart switches connect directly to your Wi-Fi network, while others require a bridge to your router. If you&rsquo;ve invested in a smart home system&mdash;<a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3384916/samsung-smartthings-hub-2018-review-samsung-s-smart-hub-finally-goes-wireless.html">Samsung SmartThings</a>, <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3334881/hubitat-elevation-review-this-smart-home-hub-keeps-everything-local-a-noble-but-ultimately-impracti.html">Hubitat Elevation</a>,&nbsp;Vivint Smart Home, or any other ecosystem&mdash;you&rsquo;ll want to make sure that the smart switch you buy is compatible with it. These are the most common communication protocols you&rsquo;ll encounter.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage left"><figure class="wp-block-image alignleft"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/bluetooth-logo-100854179-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578754-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/bluetooth-logo-100854179-small.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="bluetooth logo" loading="lazy" /></a></figure></div>




<p><strong>Bluetooth </strong>This type of smart switch is controlled directly by an app on your smartphone or tablet. Bluetooth smart lighting is simple, because you don&rsquo;t need a hub or a connection to your home network. That isolation also makes it secure, because you must be within about 30 feet of the switch to pair with it. On the other hand, authorized users <em>also</em> must be within 30 feet of a Bluetooth switch to control it, and you can&rsquo;t control the switch when you&rsquo;re away from home (although most Bluetooth switches can be controlled according to a pre-programmed schedule). The other major limitation of Bluetooth switches is that they can&rsquo;t be controlled by smart speakers or smart home hubs, which generally rely on one of the other wireless protocols described here.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage left"><figure class="wp-block-image alignleft"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/lutron-caseta-logo-100854181-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578754-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/lutron-caseta-logo-100854181-small.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="lutron caseta logo" loading="lazy" /></a></figure></div>




<p><strong>Lutron Clear Connect</strong> This is a proprietary wireless protocol used by Lutron Cas&eacute;ta Wireless smart home devices, including switches, dimmers, ceiling fan controllers, occupancy sensors, motorized shades, and battery-powered remote controls. You can also control a limited number of third-party devices with Lutron&rsquo;s app&mdash;ranging from thermostats to Wi-Fi speakers&mdash;and incorporate them into smart home &ldquo;scenes.&rdquo; Clear Connect operates independently of your Wi-Fi network, but you must hardwire a Lutron Smart Bridge to your router to use it. You can control Lutron Cas&eacute;ta devices via Lutron&rsquo;s app, with voice commands spoken to smart speakers, and from mobile devices anywhere you have broadband access. Some smart home systems, including Samsung SmartThings, can also incorporate Lutron&rsquo;s smart home products.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage left"><figure class="wp-block-image alignleft"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/wifi-logo-100854182-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578754-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/wifi-logo-100854182-small.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="wifi logo" loading="lazy" /></a></figure></div>




<p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong> This is a relatively recent trend in smart switches, probably because Wi-Fi hasn&rsquo;t always been the best means of blanketing a home with connectivity. Mesh Wi-Fi routers, however, have gone a long way to remedying that problem. The attraction of Wi-Fi smart switches is that they don&rsquo;t require a hub or a bridge to connect to your router. Once installed, they can be controlled with smart speakers, the manufacturer&rsquo;s own app, and many smart home systems (check compatibility before you buy).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage left"><figure class="wp-block-image alignleft"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/zwave-plus-100854184-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578754-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/zwave-plus-100854184-small.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="zwave plus" loading="lazy" /></a></figure></div>




<p><strong>Z-Wave</strong> This is a wireless mesh network technology in which each node on the network is also a repeater that can forward commands on to other Z-Wave devices nearby. It operates in the unlicensed 800- to 900MHz radio spectrum (specifically, 908.42MHz in North America). Its low power requirement means it can be incorporated into battery-operated devices that cannot be plugged directly into an electrical circuit, including door/window sensors, smart locks, water leak detectors, and motion sensors in addition to smart dimmers and switches. You&rsquo;ll need a smart home hub, such as a Samsung SmartThings, to act as a bridge to your Wi-Fi network. Z-Wave is supported by a raft of smart home product developers, including Leviton, Jasco, Aeotec, and others.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage left"><figure class="wp-block-image alignleft"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/zigbee-100854183-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578754-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/zigbee-100854183-small.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="zigbee" loading="lazy" /></a></figure></div>




<p><strong>Zigbee </strong>This wireless mesh network technology is very similar to Z-Wave, but it operates in the unlicensed 2.4GHz radio spectrum (same as single-band Wi-Fi). Like Z-Wave, Zigbee has a lower power requirement and can be incorporated into both battery and line-powered devices, ranging from sensors to smart switches. And as with Z-Wave, you&rsquo;ll need a smart home hub or some other kind of bridge to connect Zigbee devices to your home network. This could be something as simple as an Amazon Echo Plus, which has an integrated Zigbee radio, or it could be on the order of a Samsung SmartThings hub, which has both Zigbee and Z-Wave radios onboard.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/08/lutron-aurora-smart-bulb-dimmer-100807236-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578754-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/08/lutron-aurora-smart-bulb-dimmer-100807236-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="lutron aurora smart bulb dimmer" width="744" height="496" /></a><figcaption>
<p>As you can see in this illustration, it&rsquo;s not necessary to remove the cover plate to install the Aurora on the switch, but it only works with toggle switches.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Signify&rsquo;s Philips Hue bridge is another solution, but it&rsquo;s generally limited to supporting Philips Hue smart bulbs and accessories. Zigbee is widely support among smart dimmer manufacturers, including Jasco, <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3564166/sinope-zigbee-dimmer-review.html">Sinop&eacute;</a>, and Sengled. Lutron also makes an ingenious Zigbee gadget for Philips Hue smart bulbs&mdash;<a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3429587/lutron-aurora-review.html">the Lutron Aurora</a>&mdash;that attaches to an old-fashioned toggle light switch and not only prevents the switch from being turned off (instantly rendering a Philips Hue smart bulb dumb), but it wirelessly controls all the Hub bulbs connected to that switch&mdash;complete with a rotary knob for dimming and brightening those bulbs and turning them on or off.</p>



<p><strong>Switch mechanism</strong>: Since most people control smart switches and dimmers with voice commands, they soon discover that they rarely physically interact with the devices in their walls. But you&rsquo;ll want to consider the type of mechanism the smart switch uses if for no other reason than to ensure its aesthetic matches the rest of your home. These are the most common types you&rsquo;ll encounter.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/08/typical-toggle-switch-100807240-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578754-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/08/typical-toggle-switch-100807240-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="typical toggle switch" loading="lazy" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Relatively few manufacturers make smart switches that look like this type of old-fashioned toggle switch.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<ul><li><strong>Rocker (aka paddle) </strong>This type of switch has a wide plastic panel that rocks back and forth when pressed to turn the controlled load on and off (one side of the switch raises when the other is depressed). These modern-looking switches hug the wall and are very easy to operate. Since a command issued over the air will override whatever physical state the switch is otherwise in, smart rocker switches typically don&rsquo;t physically flip, so there&rsquo;s no confusion when you see a lit bulb when the switch is ostensibly in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position. A smart dimmer switch might have a secondary control&mdash;a vertical slider or a horizontal rocker&mdash;for adjusting brightness</li><li><strong>Toggle </strong>A toggle switch operates by moving a lever up and down (flipping the lever up turns the controlled light on, and flipping it down turns it off). These types of switches tend to look more old-fashioned than rocker switches, but you can find smart versions of them if you want something that looks like the other switches you have in your walls. As with smart rocker switches, they generally don&rsquo;t completely change physical appearance when switched on or off.</li><li><strong>Touch </strong>High-end smart switches and dimmers feature touch-sensitive surfaces. Typically made of glass, touch-sensitive smart switches and dimmers are typically backlit by one or more LEDs that can be multiple colors. The touch sensitivity can be as simple as touch to turn the switch on and touch again to turn it off, or they can be as complex as displaying a user interface that supports finger swipes for calling up different lighting scenes or control elements. Needless to say, these types of smart switches and dimmers cost considerably more than simple plastic devices.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Wiring connections</strong>: Smart switches and dimmers tend to be larger than their dumb counterparts, so you should consider how the new switch will fit in your existing electrical box. This is particularly important if you&rsquo;re installing multiple smart switches next to each other in a single box. Remember that there will be at least four wires to deal with&mdash;line, load, neutral, and ground&mdash;and that there will also be a traveler wire if you&rsquo;re dealing with a multi-pole circuit. It can be challenging to stuff all those wires and the new switch back into the box. These are the most common types of electrical connections you&rsquo;ll encounter in smart switches.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Backstabs </strong>These are holes in the back of the switch into which you&rsquo;ll push (&ldquo;stab&rdquo;) the appropriate solid copper wires coming out of the wall.</li><li><strong>Pigtails </strong>Some switches have short electrical wires emerging from the back of the switch that you&rsquo;ll attach to the wires coming out of the wall, using wire nuts to secure them. This is generally the easiest technique, but if the switch is deep, it can be a challenge to pack the extra wires and the wire nuts tightly enough into the box so that the switch mounts flush against the wall. It can be particularly difficult if the box has other devices in it.</li><li><strong>Terminals </strong>With this type of switch, you&rsquo;ll wind the wires coming out of the wall around flat screws on the sides of the switch and then tighten the screws down. This technique presents less of a challenge when it comes to pushing the wires and the switch back into the box, but the wires can be stiff and you&rsquo;ll need to be careful to ensure the stripped wire doesn&rsquo;t come into contact with stripped wires connected to adjacent switches in the box.</li></ul>

<p>Amazon has sent a message to alternative menu systems on Fire TV: You&rsquo;re not welcome here.</p>



<p>According to Plex vice-president of marketing Scott Hancock, Amazon no longer allows apps running on Fire TV to deep link into other apps. That means Plex&rsquo;s &ldquo;Discover&rdquo; feature, which helps users find things to watch across all their streaming services, no longer works properly. While you can still use Plex to look up things to watch, you can&rsquo;t actually get to that content via the Plex app.</p>



<p>&ldquo;They asked us to remove that [feature], basically,&rdquo; Hancock said in an interview last week. &ldquo;I think that they changed their policies.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Amazon declined to comment for this story.</p>



<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h2>



<p>Amazon&rsquo;s Fire TV menu system <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1362952/fire-tv-interface-is-broken-how-amazon-should-fix-it.html">is currently a mess</a>. It gives you no control over which streaming sources appear on the home screen, and its recommendations are overrun with sponsored content and promos for Amazon&rsquo;s own video services. There&rsquo;s also no easy way to pick up where you left off on a show unless it comes from Amazon Prime Video.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1428635/reelgood-vs-justwatch-vs-plex-battle-of-the-streaming-guides.html">Universal guide apps</a> such as Plex and JustWatch provide an unbiased way to navigate your streaming options. With these apps, you can choose which streaming sources to see, then browse across all of them in a single menu. You can also create watchlists that sync across all your devices, regardless of platform.</p>

<p>When Plex <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/627301/plex-adds-universal-search.html">launched its universal guide feature</a>, called &ldquo;Discover,&rdquo; last April, it included the ability to link directly into other apps on several platforms, including Fire TV. Users could then select a movie or show in Plex and jump directly into the corresponding app.</p>



<p>After launch, however, Amazon changed its developer policies to forbid this behavior, Hancock said. Plex has complied and removed deep linking from its Fire TV app. The feature continues to work in Plex&rsquo;s Apple TV and Android TV apps.</p>



<h2 id="roku-too">Roku, too</h2>



<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Roku also prohibits third-party apps from this sort of deep linking. For that reason, Plex never included the feature in its Roku app, and other guides, such as JustWatch, haven&rsquo;t launched on Roku at all. The difference with Fire TV is that Amazon apparently changed policies after Plex launched its Discovery feature.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s unclear why Amazon would prohibit deep linking on its platform, but the reasoning may come down to control. Last February, the company also began <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.androidpolice.com/amazon-appears-to-be-blocking-custom-launchers-with-its-latest-fire-tv-updates/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1471872-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">blocking custom Fire TV launchers</a> for users who want a simpler home screen. Using custom launchers on Fire TV now requires <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-remap-the-app-buttons-on-fire-tv-edition-remotes-with-remapper/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1471872-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">elaborate workarounds</a> that involve remapping the remote&rsquo;s app shortcut buttons.</p>



<p>Amazon has become a leader in streaming TV devices by offering capable hardware at low prices. But as the company looks to make those devices more profitable, it&rsquo;s also making them less useful for folks who&rsquo;d prefer to avoid Amazon&rsquo;s inefficient interface.</p>

<p>The COVID pandemic&mdash;and in much of the country, smoke-filled air caused by rampant wildfires&mdash;has renewed interest in a formerly sleepy sector of the gadget universe: the air purifier. The best models can not only remove odors from the air, they can protect your health by cleansing the air of harmful vapors and particulate matter. </p>



<p>To find the model that&rsquo;s right for your needs, you should first consider the size of the room you want the appliance to treat. These are our top picks according to general room size. If you&rsquo;d like to take a deeper dive into this category of product and see some of the other factors we take into consideration in our reviews, scroll down the page a bit. </p>

It uses four types of filters to clean your air&ndash;three of which can be washed and reused&ndash;and its CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rates) of 332 to 369 cubic feet per minute are best in class. You can connect this smart appliance to your Wi-Fi network and control with voice commands, but NuWave&rsquo;s smartphone app merely duplicates the touch controls on the device itself.

<p>The Jya Fjord is rated to clean the air in rooms up to 667 square feet, with a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) of 265 cubic feet per minute. A small OLED touchscreen displays a small amount of information, but you can use the SmartMi Link app on your mobile device to get additional details and to control this excellent air purifier. This appliance is unusual in that it supports Apple&rsquo;s HomeKit ecosystem in addition to Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. It&rsquo;s a very good value, especially while it&rsquo;s for sale at its introductory price of $319, including a free air filter, but read our in-depth review for all the details as to how we suggest you purchase one, if you&rsquo;re of a mind to.</p>

<p>Coway&rsquo;s Airmega 150 a pretty ideal air purifier for modest-sized spaces. Its minimalist design blends with any decor, and it is intuitive to operate right out of the box. While it doesn&rsquo;t offer app control or integrate with other smart appliances, it also doesn&rsquo;t have any of the attendant connectivity and interoperability hassles. The fact that it accurately monitors and responds to changing air quality, so you&rsquo;re always breathing your best, is another reason for us to give it a strong recommendation.</p>

<p>The Wyze Air Purifier may be big and loud, but it&rsquo;s also powerful and affordable. Compatible with both Alexa and Google Assistant, the Wyze Air Purifier works with the excellent Wyze app, and it has enough horsepower to exchange up to 12,000 cubic feet of air per hour. An &ldquo;Insights&rdquo; feature tracks dust and pollen in the room and outside, and you also get your choice of three HEPA filters: allergen, &ldquo;wildfire,&rdquo; and formaldehyde.</p>

<h2 id="features-to-look-for-when-shopping-for-an-air-purifier">Features to look for when shopping for an air purifier</h2>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a guide to some of the key operational features in the category. You might also want to check out <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3356448/best-indoor-air-quality-monitor.html">our buyers&rsquo; guide to stand-alone air-quality monitors</a>, which can keep you informed of the quality of air inside your home. Since most air purifiers are best deployed in a single room, you can easily move a less-expensive air quality monitor from room to room to track the quality of all the indoor air you breathe.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Room size supported</strong>: Every manufacturer reports the size of the room its purifier is designed for, although this can be a bit arbitrary. Still, the manufacturer&rsquo;s number is a good starting point. Place the purifier in a room that&rsquo;s too large and it simply won&rsquo;t be able to effectively clean the air.</li><li><strong>Filter type</strong>: HEPA filters are largely standard, as are activated carbon filters (which are primarily used to remove odors from the air). But not every purifier relies on HEPA, and HEPA filters come in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.airfiltersupplier.com/products/hepa-air-filter.html&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-579430-1-0-0">variety of performance levels</a> that correspond to their effectiveness at capturing very small particles, ranging from HEPA H10 to HEPA H14. That said, many filters don&rsquo;t report this information. We&rsquo;ve asked and reported where we have heard back. Higher HEPA ratings are better.</li><li><strong>Filter lifespan</strong>: How long until you need to replace the filter, and how much do replacements cost? Some purifiers track filter life inside their app, which is helpful.</li><li><strong>Loudness</strong>: At high air-flow levels, purifiers can be extremely noisy (and impossible to sleep near). That said, most are nearly silent at their lowest operating levels and some have special &ldquo;night modes&rdquo; that keep things ultra-quiet.</li><li><strong>CADR</strong>: Clean Air Delivery Rate, a standard developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, is represented as a series of figures that express how much air a purifier can clean in a set amount of time. Separate ratings are included for smoke, pollen, and dust. AHAM recommends that a purifier be used in a room with a size in square feet equal to 150 percent the CADR (assuming an eight-foot ceiling). (In other words, to clean a 450-square-foot room, you need a CADR rating of at least 300.) Many manufacturers claim their purifiers support much larger rooms than this, however. Note also that CADR is intended to be measured in cubic feet/minute, but some vendors measure it in cubic meters/hour. Where necessary, we have converted these figures to U.S. customary units.</li><li><strong>Pollutant levels reported in app</strong>: What does the app tell you about your air quality? A detailed look at various pollutants is more useful than a broad &ldquo;good/fair/poor&rdquo; air quality rating.</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/05/blueair-replacement-filter-100889840-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-579430-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/05/blueair-replacement-filter-100889840-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="blueair replacement filter" loading="lazy" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Most air purifiers use multiple filters to trap increasingly small airborne particles and typically include a HEPA filter and a activated carbon filter to neutralize odors. This particular filter is used in some Blueair air purifiers.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>In recent years, however, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/indoor-air-quality&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-579430-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">EPA has reported</a> that the typical air quality indoors (where we spend about 90 percent of our time) is much worse than it is outside, with some airborne pollutants two to five times more concentrated in the home than outdoors. These pollutants include combustion byproducts, pet dander, mold, pesticides, ozone, natural gasses like radon, and the all-encompassing category of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which include everything from formaldehyde to trichloroethylene to chloroform. (These gasses can be <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-are-volatile-organic-compounds-vocs&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-579430-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">10 times higher</a> indoors than outdoors.)</p>



<p>And none of this stuff is healthy to breathe.</p>



<p>Do air purifiers protect you? The experts (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/will-air-cleaner-or-air-purifier-help-protect-me-and-my-family-covid-19-my-home&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-579430-1-0-0">including the EPA</a>) say that HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters are effective at <em>reducing</em> airborne contaminants of all types&mdash;including viruses&mdash;but are careful to note that on their own they are not enough to protect you from viruses and bacteria, and that you should still practice the standard battery of safeguards even if you have a great purifier on hand. That said <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=http://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-07/documents/guide_to_air_cleaners_in_the_home_2nd_edition.pdf&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-579430-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">high-quality air filters are effective at reducing (but not eliminating) indoor pollution</a>.</p>



<p>While we don&rsquo;t have the facilities to scientifically test the pollution-reduction claims of each purifier, we do report on the manufacturers&rsquo; specifications on that front.</p>

			<title>ATSC 3.0 in 2023: Why NextGen TV still needs another year</title>
			<enclosure url="https://www.techhive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nextgentvces2023.jpg?quality=50&#038;strip=all" length="1103263" type="image/jpeg" />

			<description><![CDATA[
<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<body><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Fair warning: This update on the status of ATSC 3.0&mdash;also known as NextGen TV&mdash;will read a lot like the one from <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579965/atsc-30-aka-next-gen-tv-remains-irrelevant-to-most-cord-cutters.html">last year</a>, and maybe even <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579156/atsc-3-0-in-2021-its-still-early-days.html">the year before</a>.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s because the new broadcast standard, which enables features like 4K HDR video and on-demand content, still needs more time to really get off the ground. Although NextGenTV broadcasts are now available in more than 60 U.S. markets, support remains missing from the majority of new TVs, and low-cost converter boxes for existing televisions haven&rsquo;t yet materialized.</p>



<p>Those involved with ATSC 3.0 hope the standard will ramp up in 2024, when they expect a boom in cheap TVs and tuner boxes with NextGen TV certification. Even then, broadcasters will continue to simulcast in the current ATSC 1.0 standard for years to come, so there&rsquo;s no need to throw out your current TV or <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/578836/over-the-air-dvr-an-illustrated-guide-for-cord-cutters.html">over-the-air DVR</a> just to keep watching free TV with an antenna.</p>



<h2 id="waiting-for-more-tvs">Waiting for more TVs</h2>



<p>NextGen TV isn&rsquo;t compatible with existing ATSC 1.0 tuners, so to view content in the new standard, you&rsquo;ll need a TV or converter box with ATSC 3.0 support.</p>



<p>In 2023, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.watchnextgentv.com/shop/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1470564-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">list of TVs with ATSC 3.0 support</a> will be similar to last year. Sony continues to offer it in all its televisions, while LG and Samsung reserve it for their priciest models. The only notable expansion comes from Hisense, which announced at the CES 2023 trade show that it will bring NextGen TV to most of its sets instead of limiting it to higher-end ULED sets.</p>



<p>Anne Schelle, the managing director of Pearl TV, a broadcast consortium backing ATSC 3.0, says a bigger boom will happen in 2024, thanks to a partnership with smart-TV chipmaker MediaTek.</p>



<p>&ldquo;That is going to be the real driver of the high-volume, low-cost sets,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>In theory, converter boxes will provide a cheap alternative to buying a new TV for folks who want to view ATSC 3.0 broadcasts. Unfortunately, these remain in short supply.</p>



<p>At present, the only tuner box with official NextGen TV certification is the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://zapperbox.com/products/zapperbox-m1&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1470564-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">ZapperBox M1</a>, which costs $250 and has a USB port for potential DVR capabilities down the road. It started shipping last year and will soon be available through Amazon as well.</p>



<p>SiliconDust also sells a $200 ATSC 3.0 version of its HDHomeRun tuner, which can stream broadcast content to multiple TVs, mobile devices around the home. But unlike the ZapperBox, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/SiliconDust-HDHomeRun-Flex-ATSC-NextGen/dp/B092GCN9NL&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1470564-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">HDHomeRun Flex 4K</a> doesn&rsquo;t have official NextGen TV certification because it <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/624370/hdhomerun-flex-4k-review.html">doesn&rsquo;t transcode Dolby AC-4 audio</a>. Instead, it either hands off transcoding to each playback device or uses a cloud-based transcoder for devices that lack AC-4 support.</p>



<p>The result is that some devices won&rsquo;t offer NextGenTV&rsquo;s dialog boost feature when streaming via the HDHomeRun Flex 4K. That&rsquo;s a problem for broadcasters that want a consistent feature support, hence the lack of certification.</p>



<p>Last year, Nuvyyo also announced a version of its <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/919323/is-tablo-dvr-still-worth-it.html">Tablo DVR</a> with ATSC 3.0 support, but it&rsquo;s yet to materialize after being <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.aftvnews.com/new-atsc-3-0-drm-requirements-force-tablo-to-dely-the-release-of-its-first-atsc-3-0-ota-dvr/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1470564-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">delayed over DRM requirements</a>. The company said in mid-December that it wouldn&rsquo;t have any updates to share at CES.</p>



<p>NextGen TV&rsquo;s backers did show off a slew of converter boxes and dongles at CES, but most were behind glass and came from companies that don&rsquo;t sell hardware direct to consumers. They&rsquo;ll likely look to partner with established electronics brands to sell lower-cost ATSC 3.0 tuners, but it&rsquo;s still unclear when that will happen.</p>

<p>One bit of positive news is that ATSC 3.0 is beginning to deliver more of the benefits that broadcasters have talked up over the years, so you&rsquo;ll enjoy some extra features if you do happen to buy a television with NextGen TV support and there are ATSC 3.0 broadcast towers where you live.</p>



<p>More than 40 U.S. markets, for instance, now offer channels with interactive elements, such as news clips and local weather. Sinclair has also been upscaling content to HDR on 36 NextGen TV stations <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.prweb.com/releases/hisense_sinclair_broadcast_group_demonstrate_advanced_hdr_by_technicolor_high_dynamic_range_content_at_ces_2023/prweb19097362.htm&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1470564-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">in partnership with Technicolor</a>, although it appears only Hisense TVs support this feature.</p>



<p>Some NextGen TV features also work out of the box for all stations and televisions, including 1080p video and dialog enhancement.</p>



<p>The standard&rsquo;s much-touted support for 4K HDR video remains in limbo, though. Major networks haven&rsquo;t yet committed to broadcasting 4K content over the air, and the increase in resolution would require a lot of additional bandwidth. ATSC President Madeleine Noland <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVUrWoOEvms&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1470564-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">told Tyler Kleinle at CES</a> that it might not become common until ATSC 1.0 broadcasts are discontinued, freeing up bandwidth. (More on that below.)</p>

<p>In recent months, I&rsquo;ve gotten some emails from readers who mistakenly believe that ATSC 1.0 support is about to go away, and that they&rsquo;ll need a new TV to keep watching free over-the-air channels. This seems to stem from some TV commercials that broadcasters have shown to hype the new standard.</p>



<p>So let&rsquo;s be clear: <strong>You won&rsquo;t need a new TV or converter box anytime soon</strong>, as broadcasters will simultaneously air all their channels in ATSC 1.0 for years to come.</p>



<p>As of now, the FCC is only requiring broadcasters to support the current standard through July, which is five years from when ATSC 3.0 first debuted. Still, the agency is currently <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.bakerlaw.com/FCC-Seeks-Comment-on-Status-of-NextGen-TV/ATSC-30-Transition&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1470564-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">revisiting that requirement</a> and could extend the deadline in some capacity.</p>



<p>Regardless of what the FCC decides, broadcasters have little interest in cutting off ATSC 1.0 given that the vast majority of their viewers still depend on it. In the interview with ATSC President Madeleine Noland mentioned above, Noland said she expects the transition period to be about 10 years, which means ATSC 1.0 would be around until 2028 or so.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Truth be told, it would be counter to a broadcaster&rsquo;s best interest to turn off a service that people are watching,&rdquo; Noland said. &ldquo;It needs to get to the point where there&rsquo;s a critical mass.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Maybe that will finally start to happen in earnest in 2024.</p>

</div>


<p>With the ability to filter the air in all but the largest rooms, the Dreo Macro Max S is a smart buy for those with indoor air problems. Boasting a three-stage HEPA filtration process along with automatic sensing and air-flow, the Macro Max S is an easy-to-use air purifier that can run 24/7. It might be a bit large, but this floor air filter can sure clear the air.</p>



<p>Measuring 11.2 x 11.2 x 21.0 inches (WxDxH), the Dreo Macro Max S is more than a third larger than the already big <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1370502/wyze-air-purifier-review.html">Wyze Air Purifier</a>, and it&rsquo;s positively humongous compared to tabletop air cleaners such as the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/921215/clorox-alexa-smart-tabletop-air-purifier-review.html">Clorox Smart Tabletop Air Purifier</a>. Weighing a little less than 12 pounds, the Dreo Macro Max S can be moved from room to room as needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Dreo&rsquo;s styling is so bland that the gray-and-black device should disappear into a corner. On the other hand, its unique vertical status display (more on that in a moment) may make it a conversation starter.</p>



<p>This review is part of TechHive&rsquo;s in-depth coverage of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579430/best-air-purifiers.html">the best air purifiers</a>.</p>



<p>Aimed at mid- to large-sized rooms, the Dreo Macro Max S draws air through the shotgun holes in the bottom third of the unit and channels the flow through the three-stage H-13 HEPA filter, which reduces up to 99.97 percent of particulates, bacteria and viruses. The final stage in the purification process is an activated charcoal layer that grabs odors and solvent vapors.</p>



<p>In addition to four manual fan speed settings, the Macro Max S has an Auto mode. When Auto mode is enabled, a laser sensor inside the device scans for dust and pollutants larger than 0.3 microns, and the purifier continuously adjusts its air flow to compensate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One quibble: There are no louvres to direct the clean air flow out of the top.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="how-powerful-is-the-dreo-macro-max-s-air-purifier">How powerful is the Dreo Macro Max S Air Purifier?</h2>



<p>With a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) of 464 cubic meters per hour, the Dreo Macro Max S Air Purifier blows away the Wyze Air Purifier&rsquo;s 350 m<sup>3</sup>/hr, making it appropriate for larger rooms or those that might experience recurring air problems, such as kitchens or furnace rooms. Dreo rates the Macro Max S as capable of cleaning the air in a 273 square-foot room, or of replacing the air every nine minutes in a 300 square-foot room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While devices like the Wyze Air Purifier have different filters designed for capturing solvents, allergens, or smoke, there&rsquo;s only one filter available for the Dreo Macro Max S. The general-purpose H-13 HEPA filter is designed to last several months and sells for $50 through the Dreo Web site versus between $35 and $60 for the Wyze replacement filters. It&rsquo;s easy to set up a replacement schedule with automatic delivery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You get a five-year warranty if you register the Dreo Macro Max S. That&rsquo;s a world better than the Wyze Air Purifier&rsquo;s one-year coverage. Neither warranty, however, includes the all-important air filters, which can overwhelm the initial cost of the purifier in a couple of years.</p>



<h2 id="how-are-the-dreo-macro-max-ss-display-and-controls">How are the Dreo Macro Max S&rsquo;s display and controls?</h2>



<p>Rather than a single LCD screen to show the unit&rsquo;s status, the Macro Max S has <em>two </em>displays, and the second is something of an eye-popper. </p>



<p>On top, the circular control panel shows if the unit is on or off, what the fan setting is, and whether Auto mode is engaged. There are also buttons and lights for resetting the Wi-Fi connection and changing the filter.</p>



<p>More striking is the Macro Max S&rsquo;s vertical display, a long, thick stripe that extends from bottom to top along the front edge. When it&rsquo;s blue, everything is good. A green light indicates OK air quality, while orange warns of deteriorating indoor conditions. Red means you should move to a different room or open the windows.</p>



<p>The default setting shows the current air quality, but the vertical display can also be set to show filter status or the particulate level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indicators near the top of the vertical stripe cover everything from fan speed and Auto mode to Wi-Fi status and whether the filter needs to be changed. The display can be set to shut off at night, and the unit&rsquo;s settings can be locked.</p>



<h2 id="how-difficult-is-setup-for-the-dreo-macro-max-s">How difficult is setup for the Dreo Macro Max S?</h2>



<p>After I opened the box and removed the plastic wrap around the HEPA filter, I loaded the Dreo app on my Samsung Galaxy S9 phone; there&rsquo;s also an app for iPhones and iPads.</p>



<p>I put the filter back in, snapped the lid shut, plugged the unit in, opened the Dreo app, and tapped a button to add a device. Next, I picked the Macro Max S from a list of pictures and entered my Wi-Fi network and password (the unit connects on the 2.4GHz band only).</p>



<p>All told, the setup process took 5 minutes, and I was soon able to remotely turn the Macro Max S on or off, make adjustments, and turn the light off. Happily, the Dreo&rsquo;s reacted nearly instantaneously to commands from the app, compared to the Wyze Air Purifier&rsquo;s delayed response.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brian Nadel/Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="does-the-macro-max-s-use-the-dreo-app">Does the Macro Max S use the Dreo app?</h2>



<p>The Macro Max S comes into its own with the Dreo app. I was able to set up a sleep schedule, adjust the fan, and see the air quality in the room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The app showed the filter&rsquo;s remaining life and where to buy new ones.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a timer to schedule on and off periods, and the purifier also responds to Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.</p>



<p>The Dreo&rsquo;s graph of local air quality level over time is similar to the one offered by the Wyze Air Purifier, making it easy to spot air quality trends.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dreo-app-screenshot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Dreo app screenshot" class="wp-image-1468905" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dreo-app-screenshot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dreo-app-screenshot.jpg?resize=300%2C206&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dreo-app-screenshot.jpg?resize=768%2C526&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dreo-app-screenshot.jpg?resize=1200%2C822&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dreo-app-screenshot.jpg?resize=1536%2C1052&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dreo-app-screenshot.jpg?resize=2048%2C1403&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w" width="1200" height="822" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption><p>The Dreo app lets you set sleep schedules, adjust the fan speed, and see the air quality in the room.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brian Nadel/Foundry</p></div>



<p>With a power consumption of 5.7 watts, the Macro Max S is an electrical miser. If it&rsquo;s left on 24/7, the unit will cost roughly $7.50 a year in electricity bills, assuming you pay the national average of 15 cents per kilowatt-hour.</p>



<p>Capable of creating a 6.8-miles-per-hour breeze, the Macro Max S&rsquo;s Turbo setting delivers slightly less air flow compared to the Wyze Air Purifier&rsquo;s 7.6-mph gusts. It was, however, quite a bit quieter, emitting 57.7 dBA measured 3 feet from the top vent. That&rsquo;s significantly quieter than the Wyze Air Purifier&rsquo;s 59.6 dBA at full blast. At its minimum air flow, the Macro Max S produced 36.6 dBA versus 38.0 dBA for the Wyze Air Purifier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Dreo Macro Max S worked well during three weeks of testing, and most of the time, the unit was so quiet that I forgot it was there. That said, during a cooking marathon in my nearby kitchen, the Macro Max S cranked up its flow to compensate.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="is-the-dreo-macro-max-s-worth-the-cash">Is the Dreo Macro Max S worth the cash?</h2>



<p>Priced at $220, the more powerful Dreo Macro Max S outshines (and out-cleans) the $170 Wyze Air Purifier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both can be left on and can be controlled with a phone app, but the Macro Max S&rsquo;s unique display makes it easy to see the air quality or remaining filter life at a glance. That makes it a winner for those concerned about the quality of the air they breathe.&nbsp;</p>

			<title>Spotify HiFi release date: When is Spotify’s lossless tier coming?</title>

<p>Back in February 2021, Spotify made a bold promise to roll out lossless music streaming before the year was out. Fast forward nearly two years later, and <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579890/spotify-hifi-is-still-a-no-show-as-the-year-winds-down.html">there&rsquo;s still no sign of Spotify HiFi</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what&rsquo;s the deal? Spotify has been frustratingly tight-lipped about the fate of Spotify HiFi, but the company has let slip a few details about the missing service.&nbsp;Meanwhile, recent rumors suggests that Spotify HiFi may still see the light of day.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know&ndash;and don&rsquo;t know&ndash;about when Spotify HiFi might finally arrive.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-spotify-hifi">What is Spotify HiFi?</h2>



<p>First announced back in February 2021, Spotify HiFi was described as a way for <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579217/spotify-will-roll-out-cd-quality-audio-streams-later-this-year.html">Spotify Premium users to &ldquo;upgrade their sound quality&rdquo; to a &ldquo;CD-quality, lossless audio format.&rdquo;</a></p>



<p>Typically, &ldquo;CD-quality&rdquo; means streaming audio encoded with 16-bit depth and a 44.1kHz sampling rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the key term here is &ldquo;lossless,&rdquo; which means that the audio stream contains exactly the same sonic detail as its source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main selling point here is that you&rsquo;d be hearing the music in the precise way the artist intended&ndash;and indeed, Spotify posted a video in which <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W07MvWbuWkI&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Billie Eilish and Finneas extolled the virtues of lossless audio streaming</a>.</p>



<p>As it stands, Spotify streams audio at 320Kbps in the &ldquo;lossy&rdquo; Ogg Vorbis format, which means the audio stream has been compressed and is losing a fair amount of detail in the interest of conserving bandwidth.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 id="when-will-spotify-hifi-come-out">When will Spotify HiFi come out?</h2>



<p>The short answer is that we don&rsquo;t know when Spotify HiFi will arrive. However, some recent chatter suggests it may still be in the works.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/truespotify/comments/y3zz63/spotify_asked_me_to_take_a_survey_after_i/?sort=new&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/article/1354472/spotify-may-still-drop-the-needle-on-long-delayed-hifi-plan.html&amp;xcust=3-1-1354472-1-0-0">According to an October 2022 post on Reddit</a>, a longtime Spotify user who had recently switched to Apple Music claimed they got a <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1354472/spotify-may-still-drop-the-needle-on-long-delayed-hifi-plan.html">survey detailed a new plan&ndash;&ldquo;Spotify Platinum&rdquo;&ndash;that boasts HiFi</a>, as well as other features such as &ldquo;Studio Sound,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Headphone Tuner,&rdquo; &ldquo;Audio Insights,&rdquo; &ldquo;Library Pro,&rdquo; &ldquo;Playlist Pro,&rdquo; and &ldquo;limited-ad&rdquo; podcasts, all for an extra charge (more on that in a moment).</p>



<p>The Redditor said the survey asked if they would switch back to Spotify &ldquo;in the nest 30 days&rdquo; for &ldquo;one of [those] features.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Well, here we are, three months following that Reddit post, and there&rsquo;s still no word on Spotify Platinum. </p>



<p>There have been other, previous hints that Spotify HiFi is still percolating, including <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/spotify-lossless-hifi-option-spotted-app/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/article/579890/spotify-hifi-is-still-a-no-show-as-the-year-winds-down.html&amp;xcust=3-1-579890-1-0-0">a &ldquo;HiFi&rdquo; icon spotted in the Spotify app back in May 2021</a> and a&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.whathifi.com/news/spotify-hifi-release-date-imminent-suggests-reddit-video-leak&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/article/579890/spotify-hifi-is-still-a-no-show-as-the-year-winds-down.html&amp;xcust=3-1-579890-1-0-0">leaked &ldquo;Hi, HiFi&rdquo; video that made the rounds a few months later</a>. </p>



<p>Following months of silence about the issue, <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579971/when-will-spotify-hifi-arrive.html">Spotify finally did speak up about Spotify HiFi</a> at the beginning of 2022, but the vaguely worded statement offered scant details:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>We know that HiFi quality audio is important to you. We feel the same, and we&rsquo;re excited to deliver a Spotify HiFi experience to Premium users in the&nbsp;future. But we don&rsquo;t have timing details to share yet. We will of course update you here when we can.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>We reached out to Spotify shortly after that announcement, but a rep would only say that the company did &ldquo;not have anything further to share on HiFi beyond the excitement for the future launch.&rdquo; </p>



<p>More recently, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek dodged a question about Spotify HiFi <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4549127-spotify-technology-sa-spot-q3-2022-earnings-call-transcript&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">during the streamer&rsquo;s third-quarter 2022 earnings call</a> in late October.</p>



<h2 id="how-much-will-spotify-hifi-cost">How much will Spotify HiFi cost?</h2>



<p>Again, we don&rsquo;t know for sure, but <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1354472/spotify-may-still-drop-the-needle-on-long-delayed-hifi-plan.html">according to the &ldquo;Spotify Platinum&rdquo; rumor</a> detailed above, the purported survey pegged the price at $19.99 a month, or double the $9.99/month Spotify Individual plan. Ouch.</p>



<p>While Spotify has never come out and said that HiFi would cost extra, the wording of its initial announcement&ndash;&ldquo;Premium subscribers in select markets <strong>will be able to upgrade</strong> their sound quality to Spotify HiFi&rdquo;&ndash;suggests that HiFi is either an add-on or included in a new plan, such as the possible Spotify Platinum tier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.whathifi.com/us/features/where-is-spotify-hi-fi-and-do-we-still-want-a-lossless-spotify-tier&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Spotify tested CD-quality audio streams as early as 2017</a>, and at that time, it charged an extra $7.50 a month for the privilege.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>When was Spotify HiFi <em>supposed</em> to come out?</h2>



<p>Spotify never gave a precise release date for Spotify HiFi, but during its 2021 announcement, it said the feature would arrive &ldquo;later this year&rdquo; in &ldquo;select&rdquo; markets.</p>



<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s fair to say that Spotify HiFi missed its launch window by a fairly large margin.</p>



<h2 id="why-hasnt-spotify-hifi-come-out-yet">Why hasn&rsquo;t Spotify HiFi come out yet?</h2>



<p>Good question. Back in February 2022, Spotify CEO Daniel Ed blamed &ldquo;licensing&rdquo; issues when asked about the fate of Spotify HiFi during a company earnings call. Here&rsquo;s the exact quote, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/04/spotify-ceo-hints-hifi-tier-delay-is-related-to-licensing-issues/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">as reported by TechCrunch</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&ldquo;Many of the features that we talk about and especially that&rsquo;s related to music ends up into licensing,&rdquo; Ek told investors. &ldquo;So I can&rsquo;t really announce any specifics on this other than to say that we&rsquo;re in constant dialogue with our partners to bring this to market.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>There is another reason that Spotify might have delayed Spotify HiFi: because it got caught flat-footed by Apple and Amazon.</p>



<p>Just three months after the Spotify HiFi announcement, Amazon and Apple both announced (separately, but on the same day) that <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579422/amazon-apple-announce-lossless-music-streaming-at-no-extra-cost.html">they would begin offering lossless, high-resolution, <em>and</em> spatial audio music tracks</a>, all for no extra charge. (Apple was completely new to lossless and spatial audio streaming, while Amazon had previously been charging extra for lossless and spatial tracks.)</p>



<p>Following the Amazon and Apple announcements, the prospect of paying extra (most likely) for only CD-quality music and (probably) no spatial audio began to lose its luster, so perhaps Spotify chose to retreat and regroup.</p>



<h2 id="will-spotify-hifi-offer-high-resolution-music-streaming">Will Spotify HiFi offer high-resolution music streaming?</h2>



<p>Plenty of Spotify&rsquo;s streaming music rivals, including Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, Qobuz, and Tidal, offer &ldquo;high-resolution&rdquo; music streaming&ndash;that is, audio that&rsquo;s encoded at a higher resolution and sampling rate than CD-quality 16-bit/44.1kHz audio tracks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most industry types agree that 24-bit/48kHz is the threshold for high-resolution audio, and those streamers that support it deliver high-res streams all the way up to 24-bit/192kHz.</p>



<p>But Spotify never said anything about high-resolution audio in its initial Spotify HiFi announcement; all it promised was &ldquo;CD-quality&rdquo; audio, which qualifies as &ldquo;hi-fi&rdquo; but not &ldquo;hi-res.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the &ldquo;Spotify Platinum&rdquo; rumors, the purported survey makes mention of a &ldquo;Studio Sound&rdquo; feature in addition to HiFi. Could &ldquo;Studio Sound&rdquo; mean hi-res music? Hmmm.</p>



<p>In any event, it&rsquo;s a matter of heated debate whether the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://hometheaterhifi.com/editorial/oped/is-high-resolution-audio-audible-or-not-audible-and-a-waste-of-data-storage/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">human ear can actually tell the difference between CD-quality and high-resolution audio</a>&ndash;or for that matter, whether most folks can discern the difference between lossy and lossless. We won&rsquo;t dive into <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://online.berklee.edu/takenote/high-fidelity-music-streaming-can-you-tell-the-difference/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">lossy-vs.-lossless rabbit hole</a> here.</p>



<h2 id="will-spotify-hifi-offer-spatial-audio">Will Spotify HiFi offer spatial audio?</h2>



<p>As with high-resolution audio, Spotify never said anything about spatial audio&ndash;that is, music tracks that have been mixed with 3D surround effects&ndash;in its Spotify HiFi announcement.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Spotify competitors Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Tidal <em>do</em> offer spatial audio tracks in such formats as Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio.</p>



<p>Again, Spotify might actually have spatial audio plans in the works&ndash;and perhaps that&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;Studio Sound&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;Headphone Tuner&rdquo; features from the Spotify Platinum rumors are all about.</p>



<h2 id="will-spotify-hifi-get-cancelled">Will Spotify HiFi get cancelled?</h2>



<p>Well, anything&rsquo;s possible, and Spotify <em>has</em> been known to nix high-profile features that never quite took off. </p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spotify-has-killed-carthing-and-were-getting-worried-about-hi-fi-now-4253668&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Spotify recently pulled the plug on Car Thing</a>, a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/spotify-launches-an-in-car-entertainment-system-car-thing/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">small touchscreen display</a> that you could install on a car dashboard for on-the-road Spotify streaming. </p>



<p>For its part, Spotify said that while Car Thing &ldquo;worked as intended,&rdquo; it chose to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/27/spotify-exits-short-lived-car-thing-hardware-play-as-reports-q2-maus-of-433m-offsetting-russia-exit-and-service-outage/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">halt production of the $80 device</a> due to &ldquo;product demand and supply chain issues,&rdquo; among other factors.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/truespotify/comments/t7xjzs/spotify_features_disappear_and_come_back_after/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Spotify also has a history of testing, teasing, and rolling out new features</a> that later disappear&ndash;or even reappear&ndash;without explanation. </p>



<p>But while Spotify seems willing to cancel features that aren&rsquo;t working, it also likes to experiment, and Spotify HiFi could be a project that Spotify is content to tinker with indefinitely. </p>



<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-22/five-things-to-know-about-spotify-hifi/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-790882-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">official Spotify HiFi announcement is still live on Spotify&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>

</div>


<p>The Audiolab 6000N Play streamer takes the streaming capabilities from Audiolab&rsquo;s popular 6000 A Play integrated amplifier and puts them in a lower-priced unit that can be used as a component in any home audio system. You&rsquo;ll use the DTS Play-Fi app to control the 6000N, and it can be integrated into a multi-room audio setup with other Play-Fi components&mdash;with caveats I&rsquo;ll describe in a bit.</p>



<p>The Audiolab 6000N Play streamer is best suited to listeners who want to select their music and sit back and enjoy it. Magpies who like to flip quickly between songs and apps will be frustrated by the lag built into the experience.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get the good part of this review out of the way first. The Audiolab 6000N Play uses a ES9018 Sabre32 Reference DAC, which is capable of handling high-resolution music up to 24-bit/192kHz. High-res music from both Qobuz and Amazon Music HD sounded spectacular, delivering every bit of the extra depth and detail you&rsquo;d hope to get from a dedicated streaming unit.</p>



<p>Comparing the Qobuz stream of Scott Walker&rsquo;s 1969 album <em>Scott 4</em> to a CD version was particularly enlightening. The 16-bit/44.1kHz version on compact disc sounds thin after playing the 24-bit/96kHz Qobuz stream of songs like &ldquo;On Your Own Again&rdquo; and &ldquo;Boy Child.&rdquo; The fully orchestrated tracks have a presence that CD just can&rsquo;t match.</p>



<p>A great CD player will almost always sound better than a 16-bit/44.1 kHz stream, even though both are supposed to be playing back at the same bit rate, so there&rsquo;s plenty of reason to keep those discs in your collection. Properly mastered high-res music can be a revelation, especially when you have a way to play it back through a home audio system. The 6000N Play delivers wonderful sound with high-res tracks from those two music-streaming services.</p>

<p>The Audiolab 6000N Play has a completely neutral look, with just a power button and six preset buttons on its front. The streamer measures 2.6&rdquo; x 17.5&rdquo; W x 12.3 inches (HxWxD) and weighs 10.8 lbs. It&rsquo;s available in silver or black.</p>



<p>This player doesn&rsquo;t have an onboard amplifier, so you&rsquo;ll need to connect it to an outboard amp, an A/V receiver, or powered speakers. It has analog stereo RCA outputs as well as coaxial and optical digital audio outputs (if you want to keep the audio in the digital domain or use a superior outboard DAC). There are also two Wi-Fi antenna mounts and an RJ45 ethernet port for those living in homes with ethernet in the walls.</p>

<p>The Audiolab 6000N Play supports high-res music playback from Amazon Music HD and Qobuz. Tidal is also available via the app, but the 6000N Play doesn&rsquo;t support that service&rsquo;s MQA high-res library, so playback from there&mdash;and from Deezer&mdash;is limited to CD quality.</p>



<p>You can also access Spotify, Napster, Pandora, Sirius XM, Audacy, and iHeart Radio in the less-than-CD quality streams offered by each service. An internet radio app allows you to tune into thousands of online stations. You can save six favorite stations so they can be easily accessed via the preset buttons on the front of the unit.</p>



<p>The 6000N Play isn&rsquo;t exactly a new product&mdash;it was first brought to market in the spring of 2019&mdash;and it doesn&rsquo;t support Apple AirPlay, Bluetooth, or Chromecast; playback is limited to the services you can access via the DTS Play-Fi app. That means there&rsquo;s no way to access Apple Music.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, you&rsquo;ll use the DTS Play-Fi app to control the Audiolab 6000N Play, and the fit isn&rsquo;t exact; you&rsquo;ll need to adapt to some quirks. By default, for example, the DTS Play-Fi app downsamples high-res music files to CD quality. If you want to hear such tracks at their highest quality, you&rsquo;ll need to turn on the Critical Listening feature in the app. Doing so disables the app&rsquo;s multi-room audio capabilities, but you&rsquo;re not likely to want to use those features in connection with the 6000N Play anyway.</p>



<p>Another frustration is that users don&rsquo;t have full access to the various streaming apps like Tidal, QoBuz, Spotify, and Amazon Music HD from within the Play-Fi app. You&rsquo;ve got access to your saved favorites and playlists, but you won&rsquo;t be able to browse any of the music apps from within Play-Fi. You&rsquo;ll have to switch to the native app, save your tracks or albums and then switch back to Play-Fi.</p>



<h2 id="is-the-audiolab-6000n-play-really-a-music-streamer">Is the Audiolab 6000N Play really a music streamer?</h2>



<p>In its default mode, the Audioplay 6000N Play is <em>technically</em> an interface for streaming from your phone. When you select a source in the Play-Fi app, the music is routed through your phone to the 6000N play unless you transfer playback by clicking what looks like a Share button on the top right of the app screen. The app then sends the URL of the song you&rsquo;re playing to the device, and, after a lag, the hardware connectsd directly to the music stream.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, you&rsquo;re giving up the ability to browse through your music via Play-Fi, and gapless playback won&rsquo;t work on albums that use it. I tested a Qobuz stream of the 1977 LP <em>I, Robot</em> by the Alan Parsons Project. Gapless playback worked flawlessly when streaming via the app, but didn&rsquo;t work after I transferred the stream to the 6000N Play.</p>

<p>The Audiolab 6000N Play is a stripped-down version of the company&rsquo;s well-regarded 6000A Play with the latter unit&rsquo;s amplifier removed. That makes it a more versatile piece of gear that can be plugged into an existing system, but it also puts more of a focus on the limitations of the software that drives the device.</p>



<p>The advantage here is price. If you&rsquo;re using one of the streaming services that the unit supports, the Audiolab 6000N play adds an outstanding DAC to your audio chain and far surpasses the sound you&rsquo;d get from a Bluetooth receiver added to your system.</p>



<p>What it doesn&rsquo;t offer is seamless standalone streaming or a slick interface to make it easy to listen to your music. I&rsquo;ve recently tested both the Astell&amp;Kern SP3000 portable streamer and the Naim Uniti Atom Headphone Edition streamer and both have software interfaces that, while not quite perfect, are truly excellent ways to interact with your music. Granted, each of them costs thousands instead of hundreds, but Audiolab and Play-Fi have yet to create an experience that will satisfy anyone who&rsquo;s been using music apps on their phone.</p>



<p>When I put the Audiolab 6000N Play up against my Mass Fidelity Relay wireless Bluetooth receiver, the Relay wins for ease of use even though it can&rsquo;t begin to match the 6000N Play for audio quality when playing high-res tracks from Qobuz or Amazon Music HD. The Audiolab 6000N Play sounds fantastic if you&rsquo;re on a limited budget, subscribe to a supported high-res streaming service, and are willing to work around its software quirks. It&rsquo;s certainly not the plug-and-play experience you can expect with a good portable or desktop DAC. There&rsquo;s promise here, but also lots of room for improvement.</p>

</div>


<p>Smart garage door controllers and security cameras are two big smart home categories, but getting both products together has either meant adding two separate devices or tearing out your existing opener entirely and replacing it with a <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579898/liftmaster-secureview-ultra-quiet-smart-garage-door-opener-review.html">new, luxe model</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the Eufy Garage-Control Cam, that finally changes, thanks to a svelte device that can provide smartphone-based control over your existing opener as well as an on-demand and recorded video feed.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the garage control and camera aspects of the unit are fairly independent, and in fact you don&rsquo;t need to connect the device to a garage door at all in order to use the camera features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Garage-Control-Real-Time-Notifications-Installation/dp/B09PRC9WYY?th=1&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1468374-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Eufy Secure Garage-Control Cam Plus</a> ($130) can control two doors and includes a 32GB microSD card (though only one door sensor, which retail for $30 each). The Plus model is often on sale, which might make it a better deal than the standard version if you snag it at the right price.</p>



<p>This review is part of <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/578309/the-best-smart-garage-door-controller.html">TechHive&rsquo;s in-depth coverage of&nbsp;the best smart garage door controllers</a>.</p>



<p>The Eufy Garage-Control Cam looks like a simple squared-off block with a camera on one side. The camera lens can be tilted up and down, while the base is magnetic, like the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/578774/liftmaster-myq-smart-garage-camera-review.html">Liftmaster myQ Smart Garage Camera</a>, so it can adhere directly to the bottom of the garage door opener (though you can opt to put it elsewhere if doing so provides a better view).</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-connect-the-eufy-garage-control-cam-to-your-garage-door-opener">How do you connect the Eufy Garage-Control Cam to your garage door opener?</h2>



<p>The Eufy Garage-Control Cam attaches to your existing opener via two standard control wires, and 20 feet of cable is included to make placement flexible. Once you&rsquo;ve connected the two control wires, the only other wiring work required is to connect the system to a power socket. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the control wire Eufy includes in the box has a soft, braided jacket, and I had trouble getting the leads into the spring-loaded clip ports on my opener, as they kept bending and refusing to slide into the ports.&nbsp;Ultimately I had to twist them around the leads used by the wall controller and hold everything in place with tape. This worked fine for temporary testing, but it&rsquo;s clearly insufficient for long-term use.</p>



<p>The final piece of the puzzle is a wireless tilt sensor that attaches to the garage door via tape or screws and is powered by a coin cell (included). The battery is rated to last for about a year.</p>

<h2 id="is-the-eufy-garage-control-cam-compatible-with-all-garage-door-openers">Is the Eufy Garage-Control Cam compatible with all garage door openers?</h2>



<p>As with most controllers of this type, note that compatibility is an issue, as modern openers use an encryption system that is usually at odds with third-party control devices. </p>



<p>Eufy offers a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://us.eufy.com/products/e84521w1&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1468374-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">basic compatibility list</a> on its website that&rsquo;s keyed to the color of your &ldquo;learn button,&rdquo; but my button&ndash;brown&ndash;wasn&rsquo;t listed. Turns out this is a variant on the common purple button, which Eufy denotes as &ldquo;Not Fully Compatible,&rdquo; without elaborating further. Fortunately, my unit did work normally after installation.</p>



<p>Unlike some vendors, Eufy doesn&rsquo;t offer an add-on product to bypass Security+ 2.0 encryption, so if your door isn&rsquo;t compatible, there&rsquo;s no way to make the product work.</p>



<h2 id="how-do-you-connect-the-eufy-garage-control-cam-to-wi-fi">How do you connect the Eufy Garage-Control Cam to Wi-Fi?</h2>



<p>Wireless setup is easy, requiring a scan of a QR printed directly on the unit and bridging the system to your Wi-Fi network. (Only 2.4GHz is supported.) After a 10-minute firmware update (which I had to try twice), I was ready to get started with the system.</p>



<p>In the Eufy Security app&ndash;which is primarily built for Eufy&rsquo;s security cameras&ndash;a simple button for opening and closing the door appears beneath a thumbnail showing a recent view of the surroundings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only additional setting included is a scheduling feature that can notify you if the door is left open at a certain time or for a certain duration. It&rsquo;s worth nothing that these rules do not automatically close the door; instead, they only send you a notification that the door is open.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="how-well-does-the-eufy-garage-control-cam-perform">How well does the Eufy Garage-Control Cam perform?</h2>



<p>In testing, I found calibration and manual operation to run smoothly and notifications were sent promptly. I did experience an issue with Eufy sending me up to four notifications for each event on my first day of testing, but after some time these settled down and the duplicate notifications ceased.</p>



<p>The camera is the other piece of this equation, complete with 2K resolution (specific resolution is not specified), a 130-degree viewing angle, and standard infrared night vision.&nbsp;Two-way audio and a basic siren are included if you want to use the system as a crude motion-sensing alarm. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the motion sensing sensitivity for the device is all over the map. On some occasions, the system didn&rsquo;t detect me waving my arms, while at other times it sent false positives from an empty garage. Tweaking the sensitivity settings helps, but I never got motion alerts dialed in to a point where I was comfortable with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the plus side, video looks good by day or night, and 2K resolution is probably more than enough for use in a garage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did encounter quite a few temporary Wi-Fi disconnects, but that was likely due to a relatively weak signal from my router.</p>



<h2 id="can-videos-from-the-eufy-garage-control-cam-be-stored-locally">Can videos from the Eufy Garage-Control Cam be stored locally?</h2>



<p>The unit can record event clips based on motion sensing or on demand, saving videos either to the microSD card (not included) or to Eufy&rsquo;s cloud service. Videos recorded based on motion detection are about 30 seconds in length; manual recordings must be stopped manually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of Eufy&rsquo;s features (famously) work locally, but if you don&rsquo;t want to futz with an SD card, $3/month for 30 days of recordings on one device or $10/month for up to 10 devices is hardly going to break the bank. That said, given the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1418923/ankers-eufy-security-cameras-hit-with-new-privacy-brouhaha.html">multiple complaints related to Eufy&rsquo;s failed security</a>, perhaps it&rsquo;s best to skip the cloud option.</p>



<p>The Eufy Garage-Control Cam supports both Alexa and Google Home, allowing you to control your garage door with voice commands. Apple&rsquo;s HomeKit is not supported, however.</p>



<h2 id="is-the-eufy-garage-control-cam-worth-the-cash">Is the Eufy Garage-Control Cam worth the cash?</h2>



<p>The best part of the Eufy Garage-Control Cam is that it fills two needs with a single device, which means less wiring, less setup work, and less overall hassle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It probably won&rsquo;t save a lot of money versus other devices on the market, but there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for simplifying things as much as possible when you&rsquo;re standing on a ladder in your garage.</p>

<p>Garage door opener are the genesis of the smart home. Radio-controlled remotes for electric garage door openers date back to 1931, predating the TV remote by nearly 20 years. So, it&rsquo;s funny that modern smart home technology, which ties wireless with internet-based technology, has been relatively slow to reach the garage door. Relatively few companies compete in this market today, and many of their products feel designed more for guys who like to tinker in their workshops than folks looking to develop a soup-to-nuts smart home.</p>



<p>The good news is that these devices are definitely improving in both simplicity and capability, and while the garage door might remain a bit of an outlier in your smart home for the foreseeable future, adding a smart garage door controller to your setup offers some real advantages. Not only will you be able to open and shut the door from anywhere&mdash;letting in guests, relatives, or delivery people&mdash;you&rsquo;ll also know whether the door is open or closed in real time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still a no-brainer: Everything we said about the Chamberlain model MYQ-G0301 myQ Smart Garage Door Hub is now true of the Chamberlain model MYQ-G0401: It&rsquo;s the easiest smart garage door controller to set up, the most functional controller on the market, <em>and</em>, it&rsquo;s the least expensive on the market&mdash;by a wide margin. That said, there&rsquo;s little reason to upgrade from the previous model.&nbsp;The myQ app is simple to configure and use, and the system supports a small but growing number of smart home ecosystems, including HomeKit.

<p>Meross smart home products have left us with mixed emotions. They&rsquo;re all inexpensive, but value is defined by more than a price tag. The Meross Smart Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener is on the better end of that scale. If Chamberlain&rsquo;s product doesn&rsquo;t fit your needs, this one is worth your consideration.

<h2 id="how-to-pick-the-right-smart-garage-door-controller">How to pick the right smart garage door controller</h2>



<p>While garage door openers come in a vast range of brands, styles, and capabilities, the good news is that you&rsquo;ll likely be able to find a smart controller that works with your system without much trouble.</p>



<p>As I mentioned above, the Chamberlain myQ is my top pick for a variety of reasons, but because it exclusively relies on wireless technology, it isn&rsquo;t compatible with every system on the market. To start, visit <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.myq.com/myq-compatibility&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578309-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">myQ&rsquo;s compatibility tool</a> and check whether your existing opener is supported. If it is, and you don&rsquo;t care that it&rsquo;s not compatible with Alexa or Samsung SmartThings, your work is done: Get the myQ. If it isn&rsquo;t, you can either get an all-new opener as Chamberlain suggests (although that won&rsquo;t resolve the Alexa and SmartThings issues), or delve into the world of <em>wired</em> smart garage door controllers.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/01/nexx-installed-on-liftmaster-100826663-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578309-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/01/nexx-installed-on-liftmaster-100826663-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="nexx NXG-200 installed on liftmaster door opener" loading="lazy" /></a><figcaption>
<p>The Nexx NXG-200 must be attached to your garage door opener via wires, and space can be tight depending on your ceiling height.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Actually, upgrading your old, incompatible door opener is not a terrible idea, and new models are more secure and less expensive than you might think. Considering that a wired garage door controller can run you about $100, it&rsquo;s worth thinking hard about whether you want to pour more money into an outdated system that might be close to failure, or just upgrade it from the start. (Many new openers have smart technology built in, obviating the need for an add-on controller.)</p>



<p>But if you do have an opener that&rsquo;s incompatible with our top pick, and you want to keep it around, you&rsquo;ll need a wired controller like the Nexx Garage NXG-200 or the Garadget Wired controllers. These must be connected to the opener via a pair of wires, so you&rsquo;ll need to be comfortable with some minor electrical work in order to install them. Like myQ, Nexx offers an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://getnexx.com/pages/check-compatibility&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578309-1-0-0">online compatibility tool</a>, but here you&rsquo;re likely to find that Nexx is either compatible straight out of the box, or compatible only with an additional adapter. In other words, wired controllers are generally compatible with everything, or, at least, I haven&rsquo;t found any openers yet that <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> compatible with them.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/01/garadget-installed-1-100827794-orig.jpg&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-578309-1-0-0" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/01/garadget-installed-1-100827794-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" alt="garadget installed 1" loading="lazy" /></a><figcaption>
<p>The Garadget fires a laser once a second at the door to determine whether it is open or closed.As with the product from NEXX, the Garadget must be hardwired to your opener.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>The catch involves the adapter. Generally speaking, if you have an older garage door opener, Nexx and Garadget will work with it straight out of the box. If you have a newer opener, you&rsquo;ll need their adapter as well. This is because newer openers often have a more complex encryption system built in, and a standard push-button remote&mdash;which is what wired smart controllers emulate&mdash;won&rsquo;t work with them. The solution is to place a button that <em>is</em> compatible with this encryption in between the controller and the opener: The controller tells the button to activate, which in turn tells the opener to open or close. It&rsquo;s a little wonky, but in my testing, these setups work just as well as the wireless alternative.</p>



<p>The problem is that it&rsquo;s just a lot more expensive to do it this way. Purchasing a Nexx and an adapter will run you $105 at press time, and a Garadget plus adapter costs $98. Compare that to the less than $40 you&rsquo;ll spend on the myQ and there&rsquo;s really no choice.</p>



<p>Again, if myQ isn&rsquo;t compatible, either Nexx or Garadget will make for an acceptable alternative, provided you&rsquo;re willing to spend a little extra to get the job done. We&rsquo;ll review new products in this space as they come to market and will update our top pick as warranted.</p>

			<title>Internet radio aggregator TuneIn says it’s nearing a tipping point</title>

<p>TuneIn Radio is in the business of aggregating internet radio stations from around the world, and the company&rsquo;s chief revenue officer, Rob Deichert, was in an upbeat mood when we met at CES late last week. Deichert was touting new partnerships with EV makers VinFast and Fisker as well as component manufacturers Harman International, Tom-Tom, and Visteon, a Ford spin-off.</p>



<p>TuneIn is already working with a who&rsquo;s who of other EV builders to incorporate internet radio in their vehicles, including Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar-Land Rover, Rivian, Stellantis (parent to Alpha Romeo, Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep/Ram, Fiat, Maserati, and Peugeot), and Tesla.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The average car on in the U.S. is 12 years old, so there are tens of millions of people contemplating their next vehicle purchase, and thinking seriously about EVs,&rdquo; said Deichert. &ldquo;We think the tipping point for EVs&mdash;and TuneIn&mdash;is just a few years away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Electric vehicles&mdash;and only electric vehicles&mdash;were everywhere you looked in the huge automotive zone at CES; rides equipped with large, tablet-style infotainment screens that work well with TuneIn&rsquo;s see-a-bunch, tap-one menus organizing content by favorites, formats, and geographic location.</p>



<p>Internet radio is attractive to EV builders in part because the tuners that pull in terrestrial AM radio stations are highly susceptible to interference from the electric motors powering the cars. The content available on AM radio&mdash;talk shows, sports, news, religious, and ethnic/minority programming&mdash;is as popular as ever. And EV manufacturers <em>could</em> solve the interference problem using filters, cables with better shielding, and by taking care where to fit various electrical components inside the vehicle, as Xperi Inc. communications system engineer Pooja Nair explained in a recent <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/business/media/am-radio-cars.html&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1469065-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">New York Times&rsquo; article</a> (Xperi developed the HD Radio platform for AM and FM).</p>



<p>Putting that programming on the internet, however, not only makes the interference issue go away, it opens a world of opportunities for vehicle manufacturers to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.foxnews.com/tech/automakers-bmw-gm-mercedes-charge-monthly-fees-faster-speeds-heated-seats&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1469065-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">sell subscriptions</a>, including the mobile 5G service needed to bring something like TuneIn to your dashboard.</p>



<p>So, as they did with 8-track, cassette, and CD players, car manufacturers including Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche, Tesla, Volkswagen, and Volvo have all dropped AM radios from their EV&rsquo;s in-cabin entertainment systems. Ford still offers AM radio in its Mustang Mach-E, but will soon drop it from its F-150 Lightning electric pickup.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TuneIn-coming-to-cars.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="VinFast VF 6 compact SUV at CES 2023" class="wp-image-1469071" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TuneIn-coming-to-cars.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TuneIn-coming-to-cars.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TuneIn-coming-to-cars.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TuneIn-coming-to-cars.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TuneIn-coming-to-cars.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TuneIn-coming-to-cars.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TuneIn-coming-to-cars.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption><p>Electric Vehicle manufacturers are attracted to internet radio aggregator services such as TuneIn. We checked out this VinFast VF 6 compact SUV at CES.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jonathan Takiff/Foundry</p></div>



<p>TuneIn isn&rsquo;t the only option out there; streaming services like iHeart Radio, Radio Player Live, and Radio.net all offer the means to get old-school local radio into the car. TuneIn also serves audio feeds of Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, Fox Radio News, and MSNBC, &ldquo;offered with fewer or no commercials and more news nuggets than you&rsquo;d see on the TV versions&rdquo; Deichert said, plus &ldquo;new additions like &lsquo;Court TV&rsquo; and classic episodes of &lsquo;Jeopardy&rsquo; that pack three shows into an hour.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Most of TuneIn&rsquo;s 70 million (monthly) global listeners go for either the free, ad-supported version or the $9.99 one-time-fee TuneIn Pro, which has fewer commercials. If you&rsquo;re willing to pay $7.99 a month or $69.99 a year, TuneIn Premium is commercial free; plus, it offers access to a gazillion sporting events: college football and basketball, MLB, Premier League, and the NHL.</p>



<p>As its moves into more cars, TuneIn is clearly hoping to succeed with the kind of subscription model that keeps Sirius/XM satellite radio rocking with 34.2 million customers.</p>



<p>While it&rsquo;s true that relatively recent-vintage cars with Apple CarPlay and/or Android Auto can also stream services like TuneIn, via your phone and a Bluetooth connection, the frictionless direct-to-car setup I saw in a snazzy <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://vinfastauto.us/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1469065-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">VinFast VF 6 compact SUV</a>&mdash;bundled with 6 to 12 months of free 5G connectivity from T-Mobile&mdash;would surely lure me as a car buyer to explore the next, really big thing in radio listening. </p>



<p>And by the time that freebie deal ran out, I&rsquo;d be converted.</p>

			<title>Wyze unveils an outdoor version of its pan-and-tilt security cam</title>
			<enclosure url="https://www.techhive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Wyze-Cam-Pan-v3_4.jpg?quality=50&#038;strip=all" length="97198" type="image/jpeg" />

<p>Nearly five years after its initial release, the Wyze Cam Pan is finally getting a significant revamp, including an all-new design, much improved tilt coverage, and best of all, weatherproofing that allows it to be deployed indoors or out.</p>



<p>Available now for $33.99 plus shipping, the Wyze Cam Pan v3 has a radically different look than the unibody design of the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/583335/wyze-cam-pan-review-premium-features-budget-price.html">first Cam Pan</a> and its 2021 follow-up, the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579757/wyze-cam-pan-v2-review.html">Cam Pan v2</a>.</p>



<p>The new Cam Pan has a hinged two-piece design, with the tilting, cube-shaped top module housing the camera lens while the bottom cube is attached to a circular swiveling base.</p>



<p>Thanks to the new design, the Cam Pan v3 can now tilt up to 180 degrees, versus just 93 degrees for the first- and second-generation Cam Pans. The redesigned Cam Pan still pans a full 360 degrees, same as its predecessors.</p>



<p>The Cam Pan v3&rsquo;s revamped design also enables a new &ldquo;Privacy Mode&rdquo; feature, which blocks the camera lens by tilting the top module straight down, so it faces the top of the bottom cube. You can activate Privacy Mode by tapping a button on the Wyze app.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Wyze-Cam-Pan-v3_Privacy-Mode.gif" alt="Wyze Cam Pan v3 Privacy Mode" class="wp-image-1449974" width="600" height="540" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption><p>A new &ldquo;Privacy Mode&rdquo; blocks the lens of the Wyze Cam Pan v3.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Wyze</p></div>



<p>Another key improvement for the Cam Pan v3 is that it&rsquo;s the first version of the camera that can be used outdoors. The revamped Pan Cam arrives with an IP65 rating, which means it&rsquo;s completely dust-tight and should offer protection from low-pressure water jets sprayed from any angle.</p>



<p>Also new is an included wall/ceiling mount, which allows you to mount the Cam Pan v3 (for example) upside-down beneath an eave. </p>



<p>Finally, Wyze says that the Cam Pan v3 is quieter than the first two versions, with the company claiming a 52-percent dBA reduction in noise when panning or tilting.</p>



<p>Other features on the Cam Pan v3 are carried over from the originals,  including color night vision, motion tracking (which lets the camera lens lock onto a moving object), two-way audio, and the ability to monitor the room in a pattern using four pre-assigned waypoints.</p>



<p>As with other Wyze security cameras, the Cam Pan v3 works with Alexa and Google Home, but not Apple HomeKit.</p>



<p>Video events can be stored locally on a microSD memory card or in the cloud using Wyze&rsquo;s Cam Plus service, which costs $2 a month per camera and includes person and package detection. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Cam Pan v3 will not work with Wyze&rsquo;s pay-what-you-want Cam Plus Lite plan.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re expecting an evaluation unit of the Wyze Cam Pan v3 any day now, so stay tuned for a full review.</p>

<p>Old-timers will remember Creative Labs as the company that unlocked the sound potential of early PCs with its Sound Blaster sound cards. The company showed the potential of portable digital music players with its Nomad series of MP3 players in 1999&ndash;and famously settled <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/181311/creative-38.html">a $100 million patent-infringement lawsuit against Apple</a> in 2006; the suit was related to some of the iPod&rsquo;s design elements.</p>



<p>Creative Technology&rsquo;s co-founder and CEO&mdash;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.yahoo.com/now/sim-wong-hoo-co-founder-000151356.html&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1450314-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Sim Wong Hoo</a>&mdash;died suddenly on January 4, 2023, so we&rsquo;ll need to see if the company will continue building affordable speakers, headphones, and devices like the Sound Blaster X1 DAC and headphone amp reviewed here. It&rsquo;s a tiny unit with outstanding electronic components in its guts and DSP software that requires the same kind of practice and patience it took to open a PC and install one of Creative&rsquo;s original sound cards back in the 1980s.</p>

<p>A DAC takes a digital signal and converts it into the analog audio signal you can hear. Even the most expensive computers, tablets and phones don&rsquo;t come with high-quality DAC hardware built in. Plug a high-quality external DAC into your device and it will take over the audio signal processing, and a quality DAC/amplifier combo like this one will also deliver high-quality, amplified audio to your headphones or passive speakers.</p>



<p>This has been a frustrating product to review because this DAC does some things very, very well; my experience in toto, however, was overwhelmed by the weirdness of Creative&rsquo;s janky software. If you can accept the software&rsquo;s limitations&mdash;or hope that a better version will be released down the road&mdash;you might want to buy the Sound Blaster X1 for its considerable hardware strengths.</p>



<h2 id="creative-sound-blaster-x1-specifications">Creative Sound Blaster X1 specifications</h2>



<p>The Creative Sound Blaster X1 is incredibly small, measuring just 0.4 x 0.7 x 2.6 inches and weighing only 0.5 oz. There&rsquo;s a 3.5mm headphone jack on one end and a USB-C port on the other. The X1 comes with a 5-inch USB-C cable for connecting to your playback device.</p>



<p>The unit is black with controls for play/pause, volume up and down, and a dedicated button to engage the DAC&rsquo;s Super X-Fi digital signal processing. Inside the unit, you&rsquo;ve got an AKM4377 32-bit DAC and a Texas Instruments Burr-Brown INA1620 dual audio operational amplifier.</p>

<p>The DAC can handle bit streams up to 24-bit/96kHz, which is enough for the high-res audio streams you&rsquo;ll get from services like Amazon Music HD, Apple Music, Qobuz and the like.</p>



<p>Eagle-eyed customers will notice that the back of the unit is covered by a sticker instead of having the details of the Sound Blaster X1 printed directly on the unit. Apparently, that&rsquo;s because the DAC was originally marketed as the Creative Super X-Fi Amp, but the name changed when Creative made the device compatible with its suite of processing apps.</p>

<p>When enjoying the Creative Sound Blaster X1 for music playback, it&rsquo;s best to ignore the software and just plug and play. I used the DAC with a MacBook Air running macOS 13.1 and streamed music from Qobuz. The Sound Blaster was plugged into a USB-C port on the computer, and I listened with my <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579887/focal-celestee-headphone-review.html">Focal Celestee headphones</a>.</p>



<p>Use any USB DAC with an Apple computer and you&rsquo;ll need to dig into the settings and find the Audio MIDI setup to select the output format for your stream, whether it&rsquo;s 16-bit/44.1kHz CD quality, 24-bit/96kHz high resolution, or something in between.</p>



<p>I listened to a 24-bit/96kHz stream of the 2022 remaster of Bill Evans&rsquo; 1980 jazz album <em>You Must Believe in Spring</em> and compared playback through the Sound Blaster X1 to the AudioQuest DragonFly Cobalt. Songs like &ldquo;We Will Meet Again&rdquo; gained detail and a much fuller soundstage with the Sound Blaster X1 when compared to the listening experience I got when plugging the headphones directly into the computer&rsquo;s audio jack.</p>

<p>The X1, however, couldn&rsquo;t quite keep up with AudioQuest&rsquo;s more expensive DragonFly Cobalt, which has a male USB-A port that plugged into an USB-A to USB-C adapter for my laptop. Evans&rsquo; piano had better sustain and longer decay with the DragonFly Cobalt. If you&rsquo;re someone who listens to a lot of jazz or classical music, the Sound Blaster X1 is certainly better than what you&rsquo;re getting with a standard connection, but you might want to look at one of the more expensive options if you&rsquo;re looking to get the most out of your high-res music subscription.</p>



<h2 id="listening-to-soundtracks-on-the-creative-sound-blaster-x1">Listening to soundtracks on the Creative Sound Blaster X1</h2>



<p>You&rsquo;ll need to install both the Creative and Super X-Fi apps to use the X1 on your computer. I managed to complete the head-mapping process with the Super X-Fi iPhone app, a process that involves taking a series of pictures of my head. Creative then tunes the digital signal processing based on the shape of your ears and cranium.</p>



<p>Once you&rsquo;re loaded and ready to watch, you&rsquo;ll probably want to turn on the Super X-Fi DSP feature via the button on the DAC. Now you&rsquo;re ready to get the full Sound Blaster X1 experience.</p>



<p>After setting playback to surround mode, I watched the 2022 Brad Pitt action movie <em>Bullet Train</em> via the Apple TV app. The iTunes stream of the movie has a Dolby Atmos sound mix and, after running the mix through the Super X-Fi DSP, the X1 delivered a surround experience that far surpassed watching the film with my headphones plugged directly into the computer.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sound-Blaster-box-contents.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Creative Labs Sound Blaster X1 with box" class="wp-image-1450327" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sound-Blaster-box-contents.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sound-Blaster-box-contents.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sound-Blaster-box-contents.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sound-Blaster-box-contents.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sound-Blaster-box-contents.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sound-Blaster-box-contents.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sound-Blaster-box-contents.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption><p>Creative provides everything you&rsquo;ll need to get started with the Sound Blaster X1 in the box with the dongle.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">James Barber/Foundry</p></div>



<p>To be clear, this surround experience is the one that Creative has designed to work with its DAC and not necessarily the same one you&rsquo;d get if you were using a proper Dolby Atmos setup in a home theater. When watching on a laptop with your face inches from the screen, it&rsquo;s remarkably effective.</p>



<p>The Creative desktop app also includes Crystal Voice and SmartComms Kit panels that aim to improve your mic output for online meetings. There&rsquo;s also the Acoustic Engine, which lets you tweak the sound when the Super X-Fi feature is turned off.</p>



<p>The Equalizer app might be the most important, as it allows you to not only use the standard X-FI settings, but also adjust for styles of music and a whole list of video games, including Call of Duty, Fortnite, League of Legends, and several others. That setting offers the important clue that the biggest audience for this DAC/software combo might be gamers instead of listeners whose primary interest is music.</p>



<p>The Super X-Fi app claims to have custom tunings for a collection of headphones, mostly from Creative but also a limited selection from Audio-Technica, Sony, Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic, Bose, and a few others. The Sony MDR-7506 is the only pair I own that were on the list, but I honestly couldn&rsquo;t tell much difference between the custom tuning and the &ldquo;unknown headphone&rdquo; default settings. I&rsquo;m not sure anyone who buys the Sound Blaster X1 should sweat it if their favorite cans aren&rsquo;t on Creative&rsquo;s list.</p>

<p>I used the Sound Blaster X1 with both an iPhone 13 Pro Max and a OnePlus 10T Android phone, both of which were running the most up-to-date version of their respective operating systems. To connect to the iPhone, I needed a USB-C to USB-A adapter to connect to my Apple Lightning to USB 3 camera adapter. I could connect directly to my Android device with the X1&rsquo;s USB-C cable.</p>



<p>When I used the Sound Blaster X1 strictly as a DAC and headphone amp pass-through, the results were very good for both the iPhone and the Android. That said, the experience is much better for Android users since it doesn&rsquo;t involve bulky adapters.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s nothing on the Sound Blaster X1 to indicate the resolution of your audio stream, a feature that&rsquo;s become almost standard on USB DACs from DragonFly, iFi, and Questyle. If you&rsquo;re paying extra for a streaming service that delivers high-res audio, there&rsquo;s a nice buzz that comes when your dongle DAC assures you that you&rsquo;re getting what you paid for. It&rsquo;s not really a necessary feature, but it&rsquo;s one that many listeners want.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect to use any of the Super X-Fi software tweaks on your mobile device. While there&rsquo;s a version of the app available in both the iOS and Google Play stores, it proved unusable on both of the phones I tried it with. The app wouldn&rsquo;t launch on my Android device, and it repeatedly caused my iPhone to freeze. I&rsquo;m not sure what Android users are supposed to do about the head-mapping described above; perhaps the software works with older versions of Android.</p>



<p>The experience might be less frustrating if Creative pulled the mobile apps altogether, making it clear that surround-sound processing is a computer-only feature. This is the kind of contradiction that makes it hard to review something like the Sound Blaster X1. There are features you could reasonably describe as broken, but the actual sound experience delivered by the device in the ways it <em>does</em> work with a phone make it a good value for its price.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-sound-blaster-x1">Should you buy the Sound Blaster X1?</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;m not a gamer and TechHive is not a gaming site, but I suspect that the ideal customer for the Creative Sound Blaster X1 is a gamer who also watches movies on his or her computer. The surround-sound DSP the Super X-Fi app delivers significantly improved the movie-watching experience on my MacBook Air. It&rsquo;s not reproducing the exacting Dolby Atmos mix the engineers created during their sessions, but the filmmakers weren&rsquo;t tuning the movie&rsquo;s visuals for a 13-inch laptop screen, either.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the kind of polished user experience promised by brands like Sonos, Apple, or Astell&amp;Kern, there&rsquo;s nothing but heartbreak ahead with the Super X-Fi experience. There&rsquo;s plenty to like once you dig around and figure out what&rsquo;s available, but the learning curve is too steep for most users. </p>



<p>There is a subset of customers, however, who will consider that a feature not a bug, and those folks will be delighted with the treasure-hunt element of Creative&rsquo;s software. The Sound Blaster X1 certainly delivers good value for its price, even if you&rsquo;re using it on a phone without the mobile and you&rsquo;re not looking to take advantage of the DSP processing available in the computer software. </p>



<p>If you can turn a blind eye to its flaws, you might find yourself very pleased with the Sound Blaster X1 experience.</p>

<p>Walking down the hallway to the 34<sup>th</sup>-floor Venetian Hotel suite where Brane Audio was situated at CES I heard a sound so big, bold, and booming I could have sworn they&rsquo;d managed to drive an SUV in there. A ride fitted out with a bangin&rsquo;, multi-thousand-dollar sound system.</p>



<p>Lo and behold, the hip hop sounds of Ying-Yang Twins and Future were emanating from a compact, 7.7-pound portable speaker called the Brane X, a revolutionary $599 product likely to turn the audio world on its collective ear when the word gets out.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just previewing it here with private demos,&rdquo; said Brane Audio CEO Joe Pinkerton. &ldquo;Our real coming-out party will be in March at the South-By-Southwest (SXSW) music conference in our hometown of Austin.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-driver-comparison.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Brane driver comparison (Brane driver at right)" class="wp-image-1450277" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-driver-comparison.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-driver-comparison.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-driver-comparison.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-driver-comparison.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-driver-comparison.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-driver-comparison.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-driver-comparison.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption><p>The voice coil in Brane Audio&rsquo;s R.A.D driver (Repel Attract Driver, right) compared to the voice coil in a conventional </p> driver.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jonathan Takiff/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Clearly the biggest little boom box in Texas (or anywhere, for that matter), Brane X features Pinkerton&rsquo;s radically improved take on a subwoofer&mdash;an invention dubbed the Repel-Attract Driver&mdash;that he says &ldquo;breaks Hoffman&rsquo;s Iron Law. That&rsquo;s the century-old speaker design rule which states that deep bass can only be achieved in a speaker if the enclosure is large or it draws a tremendous amount of electrical power. Our 8-inch subwoofer achieves a ten-fold increase in deep bass without increasing size or power consumption. In fact, it only burns 1/10th of the power compared with conventional small speakers in the same subwoofer range. And so will run for 12 hours on a single charge.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-X-speaker-comparison.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Brane X speaker comparion" class="wp-image-1450288" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-X-speaker-comparison.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-X-speaker-comparison.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-X-speaker-comparison.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-X-speaker-comparison.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-X-speaker-comparison.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-X-speaker-comparison.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brane-X-speaker-comparison.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption><p>We compared the Brane X speaker (second from left) &nbsp;to the JBL Xtreme 3, Sonos Move, Bose Smart Speaker 500, and the Ultimate Ears Hyperboom.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jonathan Takiff/Foundry</p></div>



<p>To defy the laws of physics, this Brane-storm replaces the conventional stationary magnet that usually surrounds the speaker voice coil with a combination of 12 moving and stationary magnets. These function in what Pinkerton describes as a &ldquo;equal and opposite force&rdquo; fashion to essentially cancel much of the air pressure needed within the enclosure to produce prodigious bass. At the same time, this transformative tech radically lowers the energy demands needed to get this speaker cranking clearly up to a room-shaking 96 decibels.</p>



<p>Pinkerton says the Brane X portable could prove just the beginning for the Repel-Attract Driver. The technology is scalable and could shrink &ldquo;down to earbuds&rdquo; or be incorporated into sound-reinforcement in &ldquo;up to venue and festival-size systems.&rdquo;</p>



<p>And it&rsquo;s not just all about that bass, Brane X speakers also feature a whole lotta DSP innovation to make for a sound that is full range, detailed, and eerily surrounding with a variety of music I also got to hear in the demo room. Everything from the pop trills of Ariana Grande to every audiophile&rsquo;s favorite demo recording of The Eagles&rsquo; live in concert (circa 1980) <em>Hotel California</em>.</p>

<p>To pull off its cool atmospheric effects, this bread-sized box also houses stereo midrange drivers and two canted-out dome tweeters. The array made sonic mincemeat of the other speakers in its size and $599 price range that I was given the opportunity to make A/B comparisons to. Those competitors included the $380 JBL Xtreme 3, the $399 Sonos Move, the $449 Ultimate Ears Hyperboom, and the $379 Bose Smart Speaker 500.</p>



<p>In the features department, Brane X will rock your joint with Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity; streaming services via Wi-Fi and the Brane app, including Spotify and Sirius/XM; Apple Airplay support; and voice control via Amazon Alexa. With IPX5 weatherization, the speaker will be able to stand up to poolside splashes, but it&rsquo;s not submersible. </p>

			<title>Rise Gardens’ modular indoor smart garden gets an upgrade</title>

<p>Rise Gardens showed off at CES an improved version of its modular hydroponic smart garden for growing fresh vegetables indoors year round. It sounds like the manufacturer has addressed some of the issues we identified in our <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579631/rise-gardens-double-family-garden-review.html">Rise Gardens Double Family Garden review</a>, which was first published in August, 2021. </p>



<p>The company says the new Rise Garden Charcoal Collection features more durable electronics, a larger water reservoir, and is easier to assemble. The new charcoal color scheme, meanwhile, is meant as an homage to that material&rsquo;s historical use to increase soil fertility.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with Rise Gardens, the company builds smart, mostly automated hydroponic growing systems featuring circulating water and integrated grow lights. Designed primarily for edible plants&mdash;green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, herbs, and the like&mdash;the indoor gardening system tracks the growth of your plants and sends push messages when they need liquid fertilizer, when the system&rsquo;s water reservoir needs to be refilled, and when the plants are ready for harvest.</p>



<p>Rise says this new model is also easier to clean. While our long-term review unit is still performing well and we&rsquo;re growing fresh produce in the dead of winter, all of the improvements Rise has identified will all be welcome.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been close to two years since <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579266/5-reasons-the-original-apple-homepod-failed.html">Apple discontinued the original HomePod</a>. But if anything, Apple&rsquo;s first smart speaker has surged in popularity since then, and there&rsquo;s been plenty of speculation about  a successor. </p>



<p>For now, HomePod users have had to settle for the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579006/apple-homepod-mini-review.html">smaller HomePod mini</a>, which was greeted by mixed reviews upon its unveiling in 2020.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s the latest skinny on the rumored new HomePod, including what it could look like, when it might arrive, and how much it might cost.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579266/5-reasons-the-original-apple-homepod-failed.html">Apple nixed the first HomePod from its lineup back in March 2021</a>, suddenly and without explanation, although it&rsquo;s fair to assume sluggish sales were behind the move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the months following its discontinuation, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.imore.com/your-old-apple-homepod-could-be-worth-fortune&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-795915-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">original HomePod became a highly sought-after item</a>, often fetching prices north of $500. </p>



<p>Given the resurgent popularity of the bigger HomePod, it&rsquo;s less surprising that Apple would seek to resurrect the HomePod mini&rsquo;s larger sibling.</p>

<p>Apple has yet to release a smart display similar to Amazon&rsquo;s Echo Show devices or Google&rsquo;s Nest Hubs, sticking instead to its audio-only HomePod and HomePod mini. </p>



<p>There was some intriguing chatter in 2021 about <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579336/an-apple-tv-crossed-with-a-homepod-wouldnt-be-cheap.html">potential iPad, HomePod, and Apple TV mashups</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.cultofmac.com/773342/combination-apple-tv-homepod-facetime-camera-rumors/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-795915-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">in April 2022, Mark Gurman noted that</a> he &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; thinks &ldquo;a new HomePod is coming&ndash;specifically, a device that combines a HomePod, Apple TV, and FaceTime camera.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Gurman also believes Apple has yet another display-equipped home product in development: a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/07/homepod-mini-new-home-devices-launch/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-795915-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;kitchen device&rdquo; that &ldquo;combines an iPad and a speaker</a>,&rdquo; although it&rsquo;s not clear whether this particular gadget would count as a HomePod.</p>



<p>Exciting stuff, but Gurman warned at the time of his predictions that the devices are still &ldquo;in [Apple&rsquo;s] labs&rdquo; and that &ldquo;not all will see the light of day.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the new HomePod that&rsquo;s reportedly coming soon probably won&rsquo;t have a display, although it may <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-01-08/when-will-apple-launch-the-reality-pro-mixed-reality-headset-apple-2023-devices-lcnfzkc7&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-795915-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">have an &ldquo;updated touch control panel on the top,&rdquo;</a></p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>The first-generation HomePod and the current HomePod mini can function as HomeKit hubs, so it&rsquo;s all but certain that the <em>second</em>-generation HomePod will have that feature. </p>



<p>Also, given <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/apple-home/matter/&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-795915-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Apple&rsquo;s support for Matter</a>, it&rsquo;s also a safe bet that any new HomePod will be able to operate as a Thread border router.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>One of the sticking points of the original HomePod was its price tag: a whopping $349, which Apple eventually chopped to a still hefty $299. The newer HomePod mini, in contrast, costs a more reasonable $99.</p>



<p>Naturally, we still don&rsquo;t know how much a second-generation HomePod might cost, although Gurman recently reported that it will <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-01-08/when-will-apple-launch-the-reality-pro-mixed-reality-headset-apple-2023-devices-lcnfzkc7&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-795915-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">likely have a &ldquo;lower price.&rdquo;</a></p>



<p>All bets are off, however, when it comes to a potential high-end HomePod with a display. Could such a device cost, say, $499 or more? It&rsquo;s not out of the question.</p>

<p>We took a hybrid approach to covering CES this year. Our west-coast editor, Michael Brown, made the relatively short flight from Portland, OR to Las Vegas and walked the show floor. Given that COVID remains a stubbornly persistent health threat, we elected to have our east-coast editor, Ben Patterson, cover the show virtually to avoid long-distance travel. Between virtual briefings and in-person meetings, each of us saw lots of very exciting new home entertainment and smart home products.</p>



<p>In alphabetical order, here are the ones that impressed us the most (we&rsquo;ll update this list as we see other great new products at the show):</p>



<h2 id="bird-buddy-camera-embedded-bird-feeders">Bird Buddy camera-embedded bird feeders</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bird-Buddy-hummingbird-feeder.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Bird Buddy hummingbird feeder" class="wp-image-1448221" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bird-Buddy-hummingbird-feeder.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bird-Buddy-hummingbird-feeder.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bird-Buddy-hummingbird-feeder.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bird-Buddy-hummingbird-feeder.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bird-Buddy-hummingbird-feeder.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bird-Buddy-hummingbird-feeder.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bird-Buddy-hummingbird-feeder.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption>Bird Buddy&rsquo;s bird feeders (the humming bird model is shown here) have embedded wireless cameras to capture images of the birds when they arrive for a snack.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Brown/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Backyard bird feeders are fun to have, but it can be hard to predict when the birds are going to show up for the banquet you&rsquo;ve prepared for them. And unless you&rsquo;re an avid birdwatcher, it can be even more difficult to identify which birds are there. Bird Buddy solves both problems by embedding a wireless camera <em>into </em>a bird feeder. The company is showing several models at CES, including a liquid-feed dispenser for hummingbirds (pictured above) and one with a seed tray. The camera sends a push notification to your phone when a bird arrives, and the Bird Buddy app will even identify bird species. You can store the images with this information attached in a database for later reference.</p>



<p>Cleer Scene</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cleer-Scene.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Cleer Scene" class="wp-image-1448626" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cleer-Scene.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cleer-Scene.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cleer-Scene.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cleer-Scene.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cleer-Scene.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cleer-Scene.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cleer-Scene.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption>The Cleer Scene  Bluetooth speaker.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Brown/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Cleer offers some of the best Bluetooth speakers and headphones on the market, so we were excited to see the all-new Cleer Scene Bluetooth speaker on the show floor. This battery-powered, IPX7-rated portable speaker is outfitted with dual 48mm drivers and promises up to 12 hours of playback time. We can&rsquo;t wait to get one in for an in-depth review.</p>

<p>Weeds are the bane of anyone who wants a lush green lawn in their lawn, and they can be terribly difficult to get rid of. Crawling on your hands and knees to pull them out of the ground or bending over to spray them with herbicide is back-breaking labor. Broadcast solutions like spreading a granular weed-and-feed fertilizer dump a lot of chemicals into the ground, and because they&rsquo;re targeted at weeds, most of the herbicide component is wasted. Dandy Technology&rsquo;s innovative family of robots, the Dandy DT-01 ($700, for lawns up to 1/4 acre) and the larger DT01XL ($800, for lawns up to a full acre) roam your turf and hunt down broadleaf weeds like dandelions and spray them with an herbicide that kills the weed and leaves the surrounding grass unharmed. Still concerned about spraying chemicals on your lawn? Dandy recommends using an organic, iron-based solution containing <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://extension.umd.edu/resource/iron-based-herbicides&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1447100-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">FeHEDTA</a> (you&rsquo;ll find several retail products on the market.</p>

<p>Go ahead, call us weather weenies. Davis Instruments has long made some of the most accurate, highest quality weather stations on the market. The one element that&rsquo;s been missing is an equally great console to display all the readings and data those stations collect. It looks as though the new <a href="https://https/www.techhive.com/article/1447034/davis-reveals-a-new-smart-home-ready-weather-station-console-at-ces">WeatherLink Console</a> will at long last be the missing link we&rsquo;ve been looking for. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1440866/displace-tv-says-its-wireless-oled-smart-tv-runs-on-batteries.html">Displace TV</a> pitch kicked our BS detectors into overdrive: A 55-inch OLED TV devoid of wires&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t even have a power cord because it runs on rechargeable batteries&mdash;that hangs on the wall without mounting hardware and can be scaled up to 8K resolution by tiling four panels so their bezels touch&mdash;again, without wires. Well, seeing is believing, as they say, and the Displace TV demo went a long way toward allaying our doubts. While we personally wouldn&rsquo;t pre-order one quite yet, the visit did leave us slack-jawed.</p>

<p>Wearing the radical-looking Dyson Zone headphones might earn you a few stares&ndash;at least while you&rsquo;re using the air-purifying component that fits over your nose and mouth&ndash;but you can be confident that the air you&rsquo;re breathing is free from pollutants and illness-inducing viruses.

<p>This fascinating system could be the next best thing to hiring Dr. Doolittle to talk to your animals. The idea is to train your pet to associate objects (&ldquo;bone,&rdquo; &ldquo;toy,&rdquo; &ldquo;water&rdquo;) and activities (&ldquo;outside,&rdquo; play&rdquo;) with buttons placed on interlocking colored tiles. Each time your pet presses a button with its paw, they&rsquo;ll hear your voice announcing the object or activity associated with that tile. Once trained, your pet will then touch the appropriate button to let you know what it wants or needs. <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1446835/fluentpet-connect-is-almost-like-sign-language-for-cats-and-dogs.html">FluentPet Connect</a>&rsquo;s inventor tells us that some customers have reported pets <em>combining</em> button presses to express more complex messages. A dog, for example, learned to push the button for &ldquo;water&rdquo; followed by the one for &ldquo;bone&rdquo; to communicate its desire for an ice cube to chew.</p>

<p>How many times have you been frustrated with your earbuds because you not only didn&rsquo;t realize their batteries were dead, but that the back-up battery in their charging case was also kaput? JBL aims to fix that problem with its JBL Tour Pro 2 earbuds, which feature a touchscreen display embedded in the case. What&rsquo;s more, you can use this 1.45-inch LED touchscreen to manage music playback, answer incoming calls, and scan messages and social media alerts, too.</p>

<p>High-end plumbing fixtures are fun to dream about, but given the cost of a complete remodel, that&rsquo;s about as far as many of us get. Price won&rsquo;t be too much of a barrier to a spa-like shower experience with Kohler&rsquo;s Sprig showerheads. Available in fixed and handheld configurations, you drop a pod containing essential oils into a compartment at the base of the Sprig and it will infuse your shower water with relaxing scents for several minutes. Kohler says it &ldquo;Sleep&rdquo; pod contains a mixture of lavender and vanilla to help you relax before going to bed; &ldquo;Focus&rdquo; combines clary sage and patchouli to help you concentrate; while &ldquo;Relax&rdquo; is a mix of chamomile and green tea and is perfect for an after-work shower. Kohler says its Sprig shower infusion system can be installed on existing plumbing and is an easy DIY project.</p>

<p>While not quite as ambitious as Displace TV&rsquo;s effort, LG is developing a wireless&mdash;well, <em>mostly </em>wireless&mdash;OLED TV of its own. The 97-inch <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1444815/lg-to-ship-97-inch-wireless-oled-tv-in-2023.html">LG M3</a> depends on an electrical cord for power, but you plug all our entertainment sources&mdash;Blu-ray player, gaming console, etc.&mdash;into a cube-shaped box that can be placed up to 30 feet from the TV. The box beams audio and video to the TV using a proprietary wireless protocol. The only cord you need to hide at the TV itself is that power code.</p>

This is the first we&rsquo;ve seen that enables you to retrofit any deadbolt with a fingerprint reader, capable of recording up to 99 fingerprints. The lock connects to your Wi-Fi network and is compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant; it can also be operated remotely. The Flex Touch Pro will log each lock/unlock event and can operate on battery power for up to 9 months with regular usage. It&rsquo;s priced at $229.99 and will be available in the spring.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re replacing the front door to your smart home because it&rsquo;s worn out, drafty, or just plain ugly, take a look at the Masonite M-Pwr smart door. It&rsquo;s packed with every smart feature you can think of, including customized versions of a Yale smart deadbolt and a Ring video doorbell. How are they customized? The door connects to your home&rsquo;s electrical system and powers the lock and doorbell directly, so they don&rsquo;t need their own batteries. The door itself has a battery-backup in case of a power outage. Masonite also embedded LED downlights into the door&rsquo;s frame: A wide downlight at the top; a circular spotlight on the side, near the doorknob; and a second spotlight near the bottom of the frame that casts a pool of light on the threshold. The Masonite M-Pwr will be available in various sizes with or without a window from Home Depot and custom installers. Prices start at $6,500.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve tested some pretty great smart sprinkler controllers, but Moen&rsquo;s product has a couple of features the competition doesn&rsquo;t. First, wireless soil sensors (you can place up to one per zone) monitor your soil&rsquo;s temperature and moisture content at several depths. Where a controller that takes the weather into account might postpone an irrigation session if rain is forecast, the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1444853/moen-shows-a-smart-sprinkler-controller-with-soil-sensor-at-ces.html">Moen Smart Sprinkler Controller</a> will determine if the soil is dry enough to need supplemental water in addition to rainfall. Second, Moen&rsquo;s device can communicate with the company&rsquo;s Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff Valve, so that the latter product doesn&rsquo;t mistake an irrigation session for a leak and shut off your home&rsquo;s water supply.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve deployed Ring security cameras all around your home, putting one inside your car is the next logical step. Once you&rsquo;ve mounted the dual-facing <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1446979/ring-car-cam-at-ces.html">Ring Car Cam</a> on your vehicle&rsquo;s dashboard and windshield and plugged it into the car&rsquo;s OBD port, it will record what&rsquo;s going on both inside the cabin and in front of the car while the vehicle is in motion. Say &ldquo;Alexa, record,&rdquo; and the camera will capture what&rsquo;s going on even when the car is still, which could be very reassuring if you&rsquo;re pulled over or get in a fender bender and need to exchange information with the other driver. If your car is parked and someone bumps or breaks into it, the camera will wake up and record <em>that</em> activity and then send a video clip to the Ring app on your phone. At that point, you can initiate a live stream to see just what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

This mop/vacuum hybrid comes with a base station that empties the vacuum&rsquo;s dustbin, refills the water reservoir for its mop, and cleans the mop pad while it&rsquo;s docked and charging its batteries. The vacuum can distinguish between hard flooring and rugs and carpets, and it will automatically lift its mop pad to prevent wetting the latter. The vacuum can even navigate around obstacles on the floor&mdash;shoes, electrical cords, children&rsquo;s toys, and the like&mdash;and it boasts an amazing 6,000Pa of suction power. Last but not least, it&rsquo;s outfitted with twin silicone rollers that won&rsquo;t get tangled with pet hair. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Samsung knocked our socks off in 2019 with demonstrations of its ginormous The Wall TV. The micro-LED technology that TV uses is capable of achieving perfect black levels because it can turn off individual pixels, just like an OLED. But micro-LED technology can achieve brightness levels OLED panels can only dream of. Everything is hunky dory until you start talking about prices, and that&rsquo;s when the nosebleeds start. And who really needs a <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/583623/samsung-showing-219-inch-wall-micro-led-tv-at-ces.html">219-inch TV</a> anyway? At CES this year, Samsung took the wraps off its CX series of micro-LED TVs, starting with the stunning 76-inch model pictured above. And while Samsung hasn&rsquo;t announced pricing, logic dictates that this much smaller TV will be a whole lot less expensive.</p>

<p>Of all the companies showing off smart TVs at CES, the most intriguing comes from an unlikely source: Xperi.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Xperi, you surely know the TiVo brand it owns. Last year, Xperi announced that it was building its own TiVo OS smart TV platform, and it will start showing up on televisions in Europe in the first half of 2023. The company demonstrated them in the United States for the first time at CES.</p>



<p>If you can shake any associations with <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/584146/tivo-edge-review.html">TiVo&rsquo;s DVR products</a>&mdash;Xperi itself seldom talks about those anymore&mdash;TiVo&rsquo;s TV software looks surprisingly useful.</p>

<p>TiVo&rsquo;s smart TV home screen is largely focused on helping users figure out what to watch. It includes recommendations from different streaming sources, and users can add movies or shows to a watchlist for later viewing. For any given movie or show, you can see which streaming services offer it, and jump directly into the corresponding app to start watching.</p>



<p>TiVo also lets you control which sources appear on the home screen in the first place. That means you can hide recommendations from Disney+ or Amazon Prime, for example, if you don&rsquo;t subscribe to those services.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoossources.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="TiVo OS source selection" class="wp-image-1448660" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoossources.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2843w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoossources.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoossources.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoossources.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoossources.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoossources.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoossources.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoossources.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>For voice search, TiVo can handle detailed genre searches such as &ldquo;animated movies from the 90s.&rdquo; You can also narrow searches down with follow-ups such as &ldquo;just the ones with Tom Hanks.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Overall, the interface looks a lot like that of the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/578561/tivo-stream-4k-review.html">TiVo Stream 4K</a>, a cheap streaming dongle that Xperi launched a few years ago. While other platforms, including Google TV and Apple TV, have their own streaming guide features, TiVo <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/694142/surprise-the-best-streaming-tv-guide-now-comes-from-tivo.html">feels more like a neutral party</a>, with simple control over recommendation sources and no aggressive overselling of its own content.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoosgenresearch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="TiVo OS genre search, showing comedy movies from the 80s." class="wp-image-1448662" srcset="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoosgenresearch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2380w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoosgenresearch.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoosgenresearch.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoosgenresearch.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoosgenresearch.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoosgenresearch.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoosgenresearch.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tivoosgenresearch.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w" width="1200" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Unlike the Stream 4K, however, TiVo OS is built around Linux. That&rsquo;s supposed to make it more appealing to TV makers, as Xperi will allow them to share in the platform&rsquo;s ad revenue and use their own branding on the home screen. Xperi says it has no plans to make its own TVs under the TiVo brand.</p>



<p>The only big question mark is app support. Unlike other major streaming platforms, TiVo smart TVs won&rsquo;t offer an app store, and will instead come preloaded with major streaming sources. While Xperi is leaning on its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://investor.xperi.com/news/news-details/2022/Xperi-Acquires-Vewd-Software/default.aspx&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1448656-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">acquisition of Vewd</a> to bring more apps to the platform, the selection will likely be lacking compared to the likes of Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV, and Android TV.</p>



<h2 id="will-tivo-tvs-launch-in-the-u-s">Will TiVo TVs launch in the U.S.?</h2>



<p>While TiVo hasn&rsquo;t announced plans to bring its smart TV software to the United States, the company it wants to do so eventually.</p>



<p>To that end, Xperi is working with Amlogic to integrate TiVo OS in chipsets for the U.S. and European markets; for now, though, the company is focusing on Europe, with TVs coming from Vestel, Daewoo, Regal, Hitachi, Telefunken, and JVC, among others.</p>



<p>All of which means that it may be a while before you can actually buy a television with TiVo&rsquo;s software. But the idea that you might someday want to doesn&rsquo;t seem so far-fetched.</p>

			<title>Victrola bows a lower-cost Sonos-compatible turntable at CES</title>

<p>The all-new Victrola Stream Onyx features the same connectivity features as the Stream Carbon, but with lesser-expensive components to reduce its price tag.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re intrigued with the Victrola Stream Carbon turntable&rsquo;s ability to stream music to your Sonos speaker system, but put off by its $800 price tag, the manufacturer hopes you&rsquo;ll take a look at its Stream Onyx, which swaps a few of its higher-end sibling&rsquo;s components&mdash;an aluminum tonearm in place of a carbon-fiber one, for instance&mdash;in order to bring its price tag down to $600.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Don&rsquo;t miss TechHive&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1443553/best-turntables.html">best turntable recommendations</a>.</p></blockquote>



<p>And where the Carbon features an Ortofon 2M Red moving magnet cartridge, the Onyx comes equipped with your choice of an Audio-Technica VM95E or an Ortofon OM 5E. These are also moving magnet cartridges, but they cost slightly less. The Onyx is also a belt-drive turntable, and it uses the same removable headshell to simplify upgrading to a higher-end cartridge, and it has the same easy-to-adjust counterweight for setting the correct downforce for whichever cartridge you decide to use.</p>



<p>In our <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1439651/victrola-stream-carbon-turntable-review.html">Victrola Stream Carbon review</a>, we praised the turntable for its excellent integration into the Sonos ecosystem and its overall ease of use, but we noted higher motor noise than we&rsquo;re accustomed to seeing from turntables in its price range. That said, we awarded the product four stars, so we&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing if the Stream Onyx performs as well in its price range.</p>

<p>Baracoda has had a hand in the development of several smart home health devices, including the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.colgate.com/en-us/hum&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1448921-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Colgate Hum smart toothbrush</a>. At CES in Las Vegas, the manufacturer is showing off two new products that will be marketed under its own brand: A smart bathmat called the BBalance, and the BHeart watch band, which features a built-in health tracker that never needs charging.</p>



<p>The BBalance is a health-monitoring scale built into a traditional bathmat. Step on the mat, and the BBalance can detect who it is (the company says it can track 100 people) and checks their weight, body composition, balance, and posture.</p>



<p>Using patented pressure mapping technologies, the BBalance detects changes in posture and balance over time. This data is synced to the user&rsquo;s smartphone and&mdash;if they have one, their Apple Watch&mdash;to provide personalized wellness coaching, including tips to improve breathing, balance, meditation, and exercise. It&rsquo;s even machine washable in cold water.</p>



<p>The BBalance is available for preorder from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569484&amp;url=https://www.bbalance.io/products/bbalance-smart-bath-mat&amp;sref=https://www.techhive.com/feed&amp;xcust=3-1-1448921-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">the company&rsquo;s website</a> for $350.</p>

<p>Baracoda also showed off its BHeart health-tracking watch band at the show. Using body motion, heat, and environmental light for power, the BHeart is compatible with any watch that uses standard lug widths (18 to22mm). Its onboard sensors measure body energy, health status, activity levels, sleep quality, and mental resilience, with data synced with the company&rsquo;s app.</p>



<p>The first bands will sell on the company&rsquo;s website in April for $100 and come in silver, dark silver, and gold metal finishes, which should match most traditional watches. Baracoda says it expects to offer leather bands and a standalone bracelet later this year.</p>
