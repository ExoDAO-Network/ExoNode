Last July, a crane <a href="https://en.cnnc.com.cn/2022-07/11/c_787840.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hoisted</a> the upper half of a steel containment shell into place. Slowly, steadily, workers are piecing together a miniature nuclear reactor.</p><p>This is <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Chinese-SMR-project-enters-installation-phase" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Linglong One</a>, whose diminutive size is a drastic shift from the gigawatt-scale megaprojects that dominate nuclear energy today. But if one persistent cadre of nuclear optimists are right, then Linglong One could be a model for fission’s future in an age of clean energy.</p><p>Small reactors won’t save the day quite yet; depending on the country, there’s still plenty of regulatory and logistical issues to hammer out. But, experts say, the 2020s could help set the foundations for a nuclear blossoming in decades to come.</p><p class="pull-quote">If nuclear reactors were aircraft, consider the SMR today a 1910s-era biplane. And it’s still on the drawing board. </p><p>“It’s a really exciting time for the nuclear industry,” says <a href="https://nuclearinnovationalliance.org/nia-staff" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Victor Ibarra Jr.</a>, a nuclear engineer at the Nuclear Innovation Alliance think tank.</p><p>When it comes online in 2026, Linglong One will have a capacity of 125 megawatts of electricity (MWe)—equivalent to around 40 onshore wind turbines. Next to a large reactor (often in excess of 1,000 MWe), 125 MWe may seem insignificant. Why, after all, would an ambitious nuclear reactor designer want to go small?</p><p>In part because large reactors can be expensive and delay-prone. The twin 1,110 MWe reactors at Georgia’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/slow-steady-progress-for-two-us-nuclear-power-projects" target="_blank">Plant Vogtle</a>, the only ones under construction in the US, will come online <a href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-3683/vogtle-project-hit-with-new-delay-higher-cost/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven years behind schedule</a>. The 1,630 MWe reactor under construction at Flamanville in France <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Further-delay-to-Flamanville-EPR-start-up" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has experienced</a> more than a decade of delays. Even more discouragingly, nuclear’s per-unit cost <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increased 26 percent</a> between 2009 and 2019—while solar and wind power prices plummeted instead.</p><p>Still, a steadfast consensus remains that nuclear power isn’t just desirable for a clean-energy transition—<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/nuclear-power-in-a-clean-energy-system" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it’s necessary</a>. But some nuclear advocates feel that placing too many nuclear eggs in a single megaproject’s basket is a bad idea. Instead, they think, a clean-energy transition might be better served with a fleet of smaller, more modular, reactors—like Linglong One. Hence the name: small modular reactors (SMRs).</p><p>SMRs may be smaller than today’s average reactor, but they’re also cheaper, less risky, and more flexible. Instead of building an airport, one analogy goes, crafting an SMR is like building an aircraft. And if nuclear reactors were aircraft, consider the SMR today a 1910s-era biplane. And it’s still on the drawing board. </p><p>Once the manufacturing process scales up—if it ever scales up—SMR-makers hope to be able to fabricate their components in a single factory, ship them out, and have them assembled on-site like flatpack fission furniture.</p><p>Linglong One is the only one of its kind under construction today. If it’s a success, China <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-launches-first-commercial-onshore-small-reactor-project-2021-07-13/" target="_blank">reportedly plans</a> to use its design to power untold number of construction projects and desalination plants. Let a thousand flowers bloom. <br/></p><p>Aside from <a href="https://www.power-technology.com/projects/akademik-lomonosov-nuclear-co-generation-russia/" target="_blank">two modified naval reactors</a> on a boat in the Russian Arctic, every other SMR, everywhere else in the world, remains hypothetical. </p><p class="pull-quote">“I think, in the next 15, 20 years, there is going to be a real chance for SMRs to be commercially available and widely deployed.”<br/>—Giorgio Locatelli, Polytechnic University of Milan</p><p>But SMR plans are not in short supply. At least seven different developers <a href="https://www.nuclearinnovationalliance.org/index.php/advanced-reactor-deployment-timelines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plan</a> to deploy SMRs in the US before 2030. Most of them are demonstration reactors, not linked to the greater grid, but a crucial stepping stone toward it.</p><p>Perhaps the largest SMR brand today, at least outside of China, is U.S. startup NuScale. This company has developed a 77 MWe SMR; they envision clumping four, six, even twelve reactors together into larger power plants. NuScale has plans to build a US plant in <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/NuScale-completes-standard-plant-design" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Idaho</a> by 2030; the company is involved in the <a href="https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/smr-tech-ready-to-move-forward-in-the-uk-22-12-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UK</a>, <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Work-progresses-to-deploy-NuScale-power-plant-in-P" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Poland</a>, and <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/NuScale-marks-SMR-progress-in-USA,-Romania" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Romania</a> as well. (Important to recall, on the other hand, that a 2010 <em>Spectrum</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-reactor-renaissance" target="_blank">story on the future of nuclear energy</a> contained this projection: “NuScale is in talks with several undisclosed utilities and expects a first plant to be operational in 2018.”)</p><p>In December, Rolls-Royce <a href="https://www.rolls-royce-smr.com/press/final-shortlist-announced-for-first-rolls-royce-smr-factory" target="_blank">shortlisted</a> three sites in England for a factory that, it hopes, will eventually manufacture the components for a 470 MWe reactor. Rolls-Royce hopes to get the first of its reactors on the grid by 2029.</p><p>Other European countries <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/eu-pro-nuke-club-explores-small-modular-reactors-with-us-assistance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have expressed interest</a> in SMRs, especially in partnership with US firms. The Czech state-owned energy company <a href="https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/domaci-bude-bezne-ze-kazdy-kraj-bude-mit-svuj-maly-jaderny-reaktor-rika-hejtman-196397" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">set aside</a> land in the country’s South Bohemian Region for an SMR project. Even France, a traditional nuclear powerhouse, <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2021/10/12/presentation-du-plan-france-2030" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plans</a> a billion-euro investment in developing an SMR industry by 2030.</p><p>“I think, in the next 15, 20 years, there is going to be a real chance for SMRs to be commercially available and widely deployed,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giorgiolocatelli/?originalSubdomain=it" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Giorgio Locatelli</a>, a nuclear project expert at Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy.</p><p class="pull-quote">Many SMR designs today call for a kind of fuel that is currently only sold by one company—a subsidiary of Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy company, Rosatom.</p><p>And, yet a countervailing force, regulation, has long been notorious for applying the cautionary brakes. </p><p>Some of those regulators’ concerns come in the form of unanswered questions. Just like their larger counterparts, SMRs will produce nuclear waste. (According to <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/05/30/small-modular-reactors-produce-high-levels-nuclear-waste/" target="_blank">one recent Stanford and University of British Columbia study</a>, SMRs yield more nuclear waste than even conventional nuclear plants.) What will nuclear authorities do with that waste? <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2111833119" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>No one knows</u></a>, partly because every reactor design is different, and no one is sure what the SMR fleet will look like in a decade or two. Moreover, some analysts <a href="https://wiseinternational.org/nuclear-monitor/872-873/small-modular-reactors-and-nuclear-weapons-proliferation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>worry</u></a> that bad actors could co-opt certain SMR designs to create weapons-grade plutonium.</p><p>Don’t extinguish the candle on SMRs beyond China’s shores just yet, though. A few nuclear regulators have at least begun to bend for SMRs.<br/></p><p>According to <a href="https://nuclearinnovationalliance.org/nia-staff" target="_blank">Patrick White</a>, a nuclear regulation expert at the Nuclear Innovation Alliance, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) has been among them, engaging SMR developers. In 2018, US Congress <a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/neima" target="_blank">mandated</a> that the USNRC create a new process specifically for new, future reactor designs. The result, called <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/blog/can-part-53-be-the-nuclear-licensing-rule-we-need" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Part 53</a>, is slated to become an option for SMR developers by 2027, though White says it may open up as early as 2025. What Part 53 will look like isn’t yet certain.</p><p>The UK government, which has thrown its weight and funding behind SMRs, <a href="https://www.onr.org.uk/new-reactors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opened</a> a modified regulatory approval process to SMR developers in 2021; Rolls Royce was the first to follow, and six other firms have applied. In June, French, Finnish, and Czech regulators <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/European-regulators-to-cooperate-on-Nuward-licensi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that they were working together to review Nuward, an SMR design backed in part by the French government; this project, they say, is a dry run for future SMR licensing.</p><p>Where, then, can SMR operators turn for fuel? </p><p>Most of today’s large nuclear reactors use fuel with 3 to 5 percent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-235" target="_blank">uranium-235</a>—the naturally-available uranium isotope that can sustain a nuclear chain reaction. While SMR designs are diverse, many will need fuel that’s more like 5 to 20 percent uranium-235. This latter type of fuel is known as high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). Today, only one company commercially sells HALEU: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techsnabexport" target="_blank">Techsnabexport</a> (TENEX), a subsidiary of Rosatom—Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy company. </p><p>So far, Rosatom has avoided Western sanctions over Russian aggression in Ukraine. But TENEX has still become untenable for many of its would-be customers. For instance, TerraPower, which hoped to switch on a demonstration SMR in a deprecated coal plant in Wyoming in 2028, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2022/bill-gates-backed-terrapower-warns-of-2-year-minimum-delay-for-launch-of-demo-reactor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delayed</a> its launch by two years due to fuel issues.</p><p>“With the exception of allies of Russia, it’s not just an obstacle, it’s a flat-out barrier right now,” says <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/people/adam-stein" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adam Stein</a>, a nuclear energy analyst at the Breakthrough Institute.</p><p>The US has started to pierce it. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act <a href="https://www.nuclearinnovationalliance.org/haleu-provisions-inflation-reduction-act-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">invested</a> $700 million to research and develop ways of producing and transporting HALEU within the country. Ibarra welcomes the investment, but according to him, it’s a “short-to-medium-term solution.” It may not be enough. One estimate <a href="https://neutronbytes.com/2022/07/19/whats-the-holdup-with-the-haleu-fuel-supply-chain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggests</a> the replenished HALEU won’t be ready until 2028. </p><p>For many SMR-interested parties, HALEU may be a key goal in the years ahead: establishing a global HALEU supply chain that’s less dependent on Russia, less susceptible to global geopolitics. It remains to be seen how Europe or the UK will respond—if they’ll let the US take the lead, or if they’ll take action themselves.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 15:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactors</guid><category>Clean energy transition</category><category>Nuscale</category><category>Nuclear energy</category><category>Small modular reactors</category><category>Nuclear energy</category><dc:creator>Rahul Rao</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/rendering-of-family-looking-through-glass-at-a-large-building-in-the-distance.jpg?id=32842967&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>The Inner Beauty of Basic Electronics</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-circuits</link><description><![CDATA[

<strong>Eric Schlaepfer was </strong><strong>trying</strong> to fix a broken piece of test equipment when he came across the cause of the problem—a troubled tantalum capacitor. The component had somehow shorted out, and he wanted to know why. So he polished it down for a look inside. He never found the source of the short, but he and his collaborator, Windell H. Oskay, discovered something even better: a breathtaking hidden world inside electronics. What followed were hours and hours of polishing, cleaning, and photography that resulted in <a href="https://opencircuitsbook.com/" target="_blank"><em>Open Circuits: The Inner Beauty of Electronic Components</em></a> (No Starch Press, 2022), an excerpt of which follows. As the authors write, everything about these components is deliberately designed to meet specific technical needs, but that design leads to “accidental beauty: the emergent aesthetics of things you were never expected to see.”

	From a book that spans the wide world of electronics, what we at 
	<em>IEEE Spectrum</em> found surprisingly compelling were the insides of things we don’t spend much time thinking about, passive components. Transistors, LEDs, and other semiconductors may be where the action is, but the simple physics of resistors, capacitors, and inductors have their own sort of splendor. <span class="ieee-end-mark"></span>

A ceramic rod is coated with a fine layer of resistive film (thin metal, metal oxide, or carbon) and then a perfectly uniform helical groove is machined into the film.</p><p>Instead of coating the resistor with an epoxy, it’s hermetically sealed in a lustrous little glass envelope. This makes the resistor more robust, ideal for specialized cases such as precision reference instrumentation, where long-term stability of the resistor is critical. The glass envelope provides better isolation against moisture and other environmental changes than standard coatings like epoxy.</p><h3>15-Turn Trimmer Potentiometer</h3><br/><img alt="A photo of a blue chip" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="d14aa72e5194eae1e55b86742cca7f23" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="b7ab6" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photo-of-a-blue-chip.png?id=32839885&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="A photo of a blue chip on a circuit board." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="ae99d3969fdd3240a97fb58806e603a9" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="364ad" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photo-of-a-blue-chip-on-a-circuit-board.png?id=32839967&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>It takes 15 rotations of an adjustment screw to move a 15-turn trimmer potentiometer from one end of its resistive range to the other. Circuits that need to be adjusted with fine resolution control use this type of trimmer pot instead of the single-turn variety.</p><p>The resistive element in this trimmer is a strip of cermet—a composite of ceramic and metal—silk-screened on a white ceramic substrate. Screen-printed metal links each end of the strip to the connecting wires. It’s a flattened, linear version of the horseshoe-shaped resistive element in single-turn trimmers.</p><p>Turning the adjustment screw moves a plastic slider along a track. The wiper is a spring finger, a spring-loaded metal contact, attached to the slider. It makes contact between a metal strip and the selected point on the strip of resistive film.</p><h3></h3><br/><div class="rblad-ieee_in_content"></div><h3>Ceramic Disc Capacitor</h3><br/><img alt="A cutaway of a Ceramic Disc Capacitor" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="6c4964e56ad19a8eb53d16f1e7fe6506" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="557bf" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-cutaway-of-a-ceramic-disc-capacitor.png?id=32839888&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="A photo of a Ceramic Disc Capacitor" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="872bee652f7325c913d824e324c53162" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="3febb" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photo-of-a-ceramic-disc-capacitor.png?id=32839966&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Capacitors are fundamental electronic components that store energy in the form of static electricity. They’re used in countless ways, including for bulk energy storage, to smooth out electronic signals, and as computer memory cells. The simplest capacitor consists of two parallel metal plates with a gap between them, but capacitors can take many forms so long as there are two conductive surfaces, called electrodes, separated by an insulator.</p><p>A ceramic disc capacitor is a low-cost capacitor that is frequently found in appliances and toys. Its insulator is a ceramic disc, and its two parallel plates are extremely thin metal coatings that are evaporated or sputtered onto the disc’s outer surfaces. Connecting wires are attached using solder, and the whole assembly is dipped into a porous coating material that dries hard and protects the capacitor from damage.</p><h3>Film Capacitor</h3><br/><img alt="An image of a cut away of a capacitor" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="a74248ed0c7b9ead909216e9baf3b9b2" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="a7aa4" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-image-of-a-cut-away-of-a-capacitor.png?id=32839893&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="A photo of a green capacitor." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="78beab03f54d9c370d1a1f456e1238b8" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="9b272" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photo-of-a-green-capacitor.png?id=32839961&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Film capacitors are frequently found in high-quality audio equipment, such as headphone amplifiers, record players, graphic equalizers, and radio tuners. Their key feature is that the dielectric material is a plastic film, such as polyester or polypropylene.</p><p>The metal electrodes of this film capacitor are vacuum-deposited on the surfaces of long strips of plastic film. After the leads are attached, the films are rolled up and dipped into an epoxy that binds the assembly together. Then the completed assembly is dipped in a tough outer coating and marked with its value.</p><p>Other types of film capacitors are made by stacking flat layers of metallized plastic film, rather than rolling up layers of film.</p><h3>Dipped Tantalum Capacitor</h3><br/><img alt="A photo of a cutaway of a Dipped Tantalum Capacitor" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="e12ae796c59a05d80bd10b69326eddcd" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="52039" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photo-of-a-cutaway-of-a-dipped-tantalum-capacitor.png?id=32840006&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="122800dfae49e4af3d4667512d1f367e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="b2801" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.png?id=32839950&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>At the core of this capacitor is a porous pellet of tantalum metal. The pellet is made from tantalum powder and sintered, or compressed at a high temperature, into a dense, spongelike solid.</p><p>Just like a kitchen sponge, the resulting pellet has a high surface area per unit volume. The pellet is then anodized, creating an insulating oxide layer with an equally high surface area. This process packs a lot of capacitance into a compact device, using spongelike geometry rather than the stacked or rolled layers that most other capacitors use.</p><p>The device’s positive terminal, or anode, is connected directly to the tantalum metal. The negative terminal, or cathode, is formed by a thin layer of conductive manganese dioxide coating the pellet.</p><h3>Axial Inductor</h3><br/><img alt="An image of a cutaway of a Axial Inductor" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="3d62e3bb85d9964ebc3816ead13f2c58" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="16dae" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-image-of-a-cutaway-of-a-axial-inductor.png?id=32839928&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="A photo of a collection of cut wires" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="826701195e81ccdb7483c97acf2410ef" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="d92d3" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photo-of-a-collection-of-cut-wires.png?id=32839930&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Inductors are fundamental electronic components that store energy in the form of a magnetic field. They’re used, for example, in some types of power supplies to convert between voltages by alternately storing and releasing energy. This energy-efficient design helps maximize the battery life of cellphones and other portable electronics.</p><p>Inductors typically consist of a coil of insulated wire wrapped around a core of magnetic material like iron or ferrite, a ceramic filled with iron oxide. Current flowing around the core produces a magnetic field that acts as a sort of flywheel for current, smoothing out changes in the current as it flows through the inductor.</p><p>This axial inductor has a number of turns of varnished copper wire wrapped around a ferrite form and soldered to copper leads on its two ends. It has several layers of protection: a clear varnish over the windings, a light-green coating around the solder joints, and a striking green outer coating to protect the whole component and provide a surface for the colorful stripes that indicate its inductance value.</p><h3>Power Supply Transformer</h3><br/><img alt="A photo of a collection of cut wires" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="99b6bc3eb5f925992e858413cc4a86db" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="cb69a" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photo-of-a-collection-of-cut-wires.png?id=32839945&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="A photo of a yellow element on a circuit board." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="eb0ddbd90537ba7d8f65f15fc94b2a8f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="c9ccf" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photo-of-a-yellow-element-on-a-circuit-board.png?id=32839948&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>This transformer has multiple sets of windings and is used in a power supply to create multiple output AC voltages from a single AC input such as a wall outlet.</p><p>The small wires nearer the center are “high impedance” turns of magnet wire. These windings carry a higher voltage but a lower current.

<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=32366663&width=980"/><br/><br/><p><em>This sponsored article is brought to you by <a href="https://www.comsol.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COMSOL</a>.</em></p><p>India is a fast-growing market for electric vehicles (EVs), with one study predicting that over 30 percent of the vehicles sold in India will be electric by 2030 (Ref. 1). The battery packs that power EVs are one of the main drivers of the electric mobility revolution in India. In order to monitor and manage battery pack performance and safety, packs are usually equipped with a battery management system (BMS). A BMS is an electronic system that monitors a battery’s voltage, temperature, coolant flow, and health and predicts a number of other performance parameters, such as current variation and heat generation, helping to extract optimum performance from a battery pack.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>The Role of Simulation in Developing Accurate BMS</h3><p>
	Exicom Tele-Systems Pvt. Ltd. designs, develops, and deploys energy solutions, including the latest Li-ion battery technologies. To date, it has deployed Li-ion battery solutions totaling more than 1.8 GWh — among the highest in the world by a single company. Exicom also offers charging solutions and BMS for electric two-wheelers and light electric vehicles, which are driving the growth of electric mobility in India. Exicom’s innovative BMS solutions are prized for their performance and life.
</p><p>
	At Exicom’s R&D center in Gurugram, India, the technology team led by Dr. Parmender Singh has developed a BMS that can be used to precisely monitor and manage Li-ion batteries in applications across a broad voltage range (up to 1000 V). This BMS is also chemistry agnostic; it can be used with Li-ion batteries of a range of chemistries such as lithium ferrophosphate, or lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA).
</p><p class="pull-quote">
	For India’s transportation sector to meet its ambitious electrification goals, manufacturers must accelerate the development of essential components, such as battery management systems (BMS)
</p><p>
	The precision of the BMS depends on the quality and accuracy of the inputs used for programming or calibrating the system. For example, the BMS includes a number of thermal sensors distributed across the battery pack. In order to accurately monitor a battery pack’s temperature distribution and predict corresponding performance, it is imperative that the sensors be placed at the right locations. This requires a detailed understanding of the heat profile of each battery cell as well as how heat varies throughout the pack. This is where COMSOL Multiphysics plays an integral part, by allowing for accurate computation and collation of the inputs, like heat profile information, that are required to develop a BMS with surgical precision.
</p><h3>Predicting and Preventing Potential Thermal Runaway</h3><p>
	Dr. Singh’s team at Exicom used COMSOL Multiphysics to perform a number of analyses on the thermal behavior of battery cells. They also used simulation to analyze potential external short circuits, which could cause thermal runaway — an uncontrolled self-heating process that can damage equipment or even cause fires. The Exicom team began by analyzing the heat generated in cylindrical cells with different form factors and further extended this model to the pack level using the heat profile generated for the cells. “We were especially interested in improving the temperature gradient across the pack for air-cooled battery packs,” said Dr. Singh.
</p><p>
	The results for thermal modeling at the cell level for cylindrical cells during a 1C discharging are shown in Figure 1. The visualization on the left in Figure 1 shows the temperature distribution, where the maximum temperature is observed in the middle of the cell. The visualization on the right shows the contour distribution of temperature, where the maximum temperature is located in the active material of the cell.

The model was then further extended for 2C discharge at 100 percent state of charge (SOC) according to Standard UL1642, which is defined for external short circuit testing.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Two plots showing the temperature behavior in a cell after thermal runaway." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="98e7474bd95ccc1dcbb2674a1902403e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="14168" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-plots-showing-the-temperature-behavior-in-a-cell-after-thermal-runaway.jpg?id=32366606&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>The positive and negative terminals of the cell were shorted via an 80 ±20 mΩ resistance. The COMSOL software’s lumped approach-based thermal model was validated against experimental data for charge–discharge profiles of the cell. They also developed:</p><ul><li>Cyclic and calendric capacity-fade models for cylindrical cells based on the optimization features available in COMSOL</li><li>A high-fidelity pseudo two-dimensional (P2D) model for cylindrical cells using extracted electrochemical parameters</li></ul><p>They found that the lumped approach enabled them to construct models using a minimal number of parameters — such as cell geometry, electrode thickness, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, drive cycle, and open-circuit voltage (OCV)-SOC table — that are readily available from battery pack manufacturers.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Two plots showing voltage and temperature during short-circuit testing, with simulated and experimental data matching." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="27a9336321963982e6d9d783e303cdee" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="23a37" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-plots-showing-voltage-and-temperature-during-short-circuit-testing-with-simulated-and-experimental-data-matching.jpg?id=32366628&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Extracting these parameters experimentally is not only a time-consuming process but also prone to errors due to variable experimental conditions. For example, ambient temperature fluctuates, so extracting an accurate heat profile of a cell requires performing an extensive series of tests at different ambient temperatures. Using simulation, however, Dr. Singh and the team were able to perform these experiments with great ease. They were able to efficiently study charge and discharge profiles, thermal behavior at different charge and discharge rates, and thermal runaway due to external or internal short circuits for different cell chemistries. They were also able to identify the hotspots in the battery pack and determine the cell grading based on capacity fade analysis with high accuracy. These results had direct applications in reducing the development cycle time of the BMS, as the hotspots indicated the best positions for deploying the thermal sensors within the BMS in order to function most efficiently. According to Dr. Singh, “COMSOL is an easy-to-learn and adaptable finite element tool for battery design and thermal modeling.”</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Screenshot of the COMSOL Multiphysics user interface." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="011b43162d48dd02aed08bfd661ff658" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="45397" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/screenshot-of-the-comsol-multiphysics-user-interface.png?id=32366631&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><h3>Future Scope: Extending Battery Simulations to Predict Aging</h3><p>In addition to the thermal simulations, Dr. Singh has expanded the use of simulations to investigate another important phenomenon: battery aging. During the lifetime of a battery, its state of health (SOH) progressively deteriorates due to irreversible physical and chemical changes, such as the growth of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, which can lead to loss of porosity in a battery cell, which in turn can lead to an increase in polarization and internal resistance. Magnetic field probing (MFP) is a noninvasive method for monitoring a battery’s SOH. With the aim of demonstrating the potential of the MFP method, Dr. Singh developed a multiphysics model in COMSOL to evaluate the magnetic field response, battery polarization, and internal resistance of the Li-ion battery (Ref. 2). The team observed that variation in electrode porosity has a significant influence on the magnetic field response. Though this research is currently in its preliminary stages, the potential applications are far reaching. “We expect that further investigation into this phenomenon will allow for developing and deploying monitoring features for battery aging as well as better protection mechanisms against it in the BMS itself,” said Dr. Singh.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Diagram showing the magnetic field and current density inside a rectangular battery, and a plot showing the field and voltage over time." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="44eea661ea0a034c06833e4d0ff1094c" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="89b57" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-showing-the-magnetic-field-and-current-density-inside-a-rectangular-battery-and-a-plot-showing-the-field-and-voltage-ov.jpg?id=32366646&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>
	The Exicom team is currently working on electrochemical P2D modeling for thermal and capacity-fading analysis at the cell level. It intends to further extend the model with additional thermal exothermic equations at the electrodes and SEI layer for better accuracy during thermal runaway. They also plan to use the lumped capacity fade model for cyclic and calendric predictive analysis. In the future, they also plan to implement a reduced order model for SOC and SOH and export the model to MATLAB for code generation up to the ASIC level.
</p><p>
	With the accelerating transition to electric mobility in India and worldwide, research on battery technology is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. Simulation software like COMSOL offers a crucial head start to companies in the electric mobility space that want to provide more effective solutions and improve the time to market for their products.

It’s also about what’s under the hood—or at least what researchers and developers hope will be inside a whole host of devices some day.</p><p>Here, in no particular order, are four such enabling technologies I spotted at CES 2023. It may be a year—or two, or never—before they show up in products, but all are worth watching.</p><h3>Nanosys’s eyesafe blue quantum dots</h3><br/><img alt="A glass vial full of a glowing liquid" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="89a50e18fd55160bbdd7eab2baadc596" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="58a66" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-glass-vial-full-of-a-glowing-liquid.jpg?id=32770529&width=980"/><p><a href="https://nanosys.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nanosys</a>, the manufacturer of quantum-dot films used in television displays from several major manufacturers, is aiming to dial down viewers’ exposure to blue light without sacrificing picture quality, by adding a blue quantum dot to its current red-and-green quantum-dot array.</p><p>Briefly, in the now-ubiquitous QLED technology, quantum dots are used to improve color quality by tuning light to precise wavelengths. These LCD-based displays typically use an array of blue LEDs as a backlight along with a quantum-dot film that converts some of that light into the red and green frequencies used to make up an RGB (red-green-blue) image, passing the blue light through unchanged.</p><p>But there is growing concern that constant exposure to blue light, due to hours of screen time every day, can cause <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/blue-light-effects-on-your-eyes-sleep-and-health/2022/08" target="_blank">problems over time</a>, contributing to macular degeneration, cataracts, and other eye problems. In the shorter term, it can disrupt sleep.</p><p>Solutions to date have involved physical filters for displays, coatings for glasses, and software settings that allow changes to the white point (which makes images look a little yellow).</p><p>Nanosys says adding a blue quantum dot to the current red and green array won’t cost much (less than 10 percent more) and can reduce the harm caused by blue light without sacrificing colors or contrast. Its zinc selenide QD absorbs blue light from what is believed to be the most harmful range of wavelengths—425 to 445 nanometers—and reemits it in the 460-to-480-nm range.</p><p>The company unveiled its blue-shifting quantum dots at CES last week and says it will be ready to manufacture them in quantity before the end of the year. If and when such technology shows up on retail shelves is up to TV manufacturers.</p><h3>BeFC’s paper batteries</h3><br/><p><a href="https://www.befc.global/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BeFC</a>, a spinout of <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)</a>, is ready to ramp up production of paper batteries for use in sensors and other IoT devices. The company says these biofuel-based cells, which combine stored glucose with oxygen extracted from the air to generate electricity, can produce energy equivalent to a coin-cell battery. The company said that 10 to 12 products that use BeFC’s technology are in development by a variety of manufacturers. Several of those products—including a temperature and humidity tracker and a smart bandage—are due to come to market soon.</p><h3>Lumus’s reflective waveguide for smart glasses</h3><br/><p>The <a href="https://lumusvision.com/" target="_blank">Lumus</a> Z-Lens reflective waveguide technology is ready to enable smaller and lighter AR glasses, the company says. This isn’t Lumus’s first attempt to become the go-to supplier of optical technology for AR wearables, but the new architecture allows for a vastly smaller image projector. And the technology that goes into smart glasses is going to have to be as small and light as possible if these devices are ever to appeal to consumers.</p><p>Typical waveguides are diffractive, that is, they break incoming light into its red, green, and blue wavelengths, then redirect and reassemble it. Lumus instead uses an array of tiny mirrors to redirect images from a projector to the eye while allowing 90 percent of light coming in from the real world to get through. The company says its reflective technology is better, preserving brightness and keeping images more precisely aligned than its diffractive competitors. Lumus also indicated that its approach allows direct bonding to lenses, making prescription AR glasses easier to produce.</p><p>The basic technology has been used in military helmets for more than a decade, but the twist announced at CES is a change in the configuration of the waveguide to expand the image in two directions, not just one.</p><p>Lumus is ready to take this technology into mass production later this year and expects to see it available in consumer products in 2025.</p><h3>Ixana’s through-the-body low-power communications technology</h3><br/><p><a href="https://ixana.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ixana</a>, a spinout of Purdue University, is looking for wearable device makers to adopt its through-the-body low-power communications technology. Associate Professor Shreyas Sen and his colleagues wrote about their then work in progress in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/turning-the-body-into-a-wire" target="_self">the December 2020 issue of<em> IEEE Spectrum</em></a>. They called their invention Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Communication; they’ve now tagged the commercial version Wi-R, and Sen says it’s ready for prime time.</p><p>This extremely low-power (sub-hundred microwatt) technology uses the conductive properties of the body to create a broadband communications bus. It will be perfect for use with AR glasses, Sen says, easily transmitting video from a camera in lightweight glasses to a processor worn elsewhere without draining the wearable’s battery. The company has announced that an evaluation kit is available for preorder.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 19:07:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/future-tech-ces-2023</guid><category>Gadgets</category><category>Quantum dots</category><category>Wearables</category><category>Paper electronics</category><category>Displays</category><category>Consumer electronics</category><dc:creator>Tekla S.

<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-image-of-a-man-in-a-suit-standing-next-to-a-large-x-ray-machine.jpg?id=32816528&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C209"/><br/><br/><p>The inspiration for computed tomography (CT) came from a chance conversation that research engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Hounsfield" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Godfrey Hounsfield</a> had with a doctor while on vacation in the 1960s. The physician complained that X-ray images of the brain were too grainy and only two-dimensional.</p><p>Hounsfield worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI#:~:text=Electric%20and%20Musical%20Industries%20Ltd,the%20origins%20of%20recorded%20sound." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electrical and Musical Industry</a> in Hayes, England. Best known for producing and selling <a href="https://www.thebeatles.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beatles</a> records, EMI also developed electronic equipment. </p><hr/><p>When Hounsfield returned to work after that vacation, he proposed a project to his supervisor to develop a machine that could create three-dimensional brain images. The machine would project narrow beams of X-rays through a person’s head, and a computer would use the resulting data to construct a series of cross-sections that together would represent the brain in 3D.</p><p>Hounsfield worked with neuroradiologists to build the machine, and in 1971 they produced the first computed tomography scan of a human brain. CT scans are now used to pinpoint the location of blood clots, tumors, and bone fractures.</p><p>For his invention, Hounsfield<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1979/press-release/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> was named corecipient of the 1979 Nobel Prize</a> in Physiology or Medicine.</p><p>Hounsfield’s scanner was commemorated with an <a href="https://ethw.org/Milestones:First_Computerized_Tomography_(CT)_X-ray_Scanner,_1971" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Milestone</a> during a ceremony held on 26 October at the EMI Old Vinyl Factory, in Hayes, England, where the technology was developed. The IEEE <a href="https://www.ieee-ukandireland.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Kingdom and Ireland Section</a> sponsored the nomination.</p><h2>Selling Beatles albums and developing medical equipment</h2><p> After the X-ray machine was invented in 1896, it quickly became standard equipment in hospitals. The machines produce great images of bones because their dense structures absorb X-ray beams well. The absorption pattern makes the bones look white on film. But soft-tissue organs such as the brain looked foggy because the radiation passed through them.</p><p>While Hounsfield served with the <a href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Royal Air Force</a>, he learned the basics of electronics and radar. In 1951 he joined EMI, where he developed guided weapon systems and radar. His interest in computers grew, and in 1958 he helped design the <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/15496/EMI%20Emidec%201100%20computer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Emidec 1100</a>—the first commercially available all-transistor computer made in Britain.</p><p>After that project, Hounsfield’s supervisor warned him that his job would be in jeopardy if he didn’t come up with another good idea.</p><p>Hounsfield thought back to the conversation with the doctor about the limitations of X-ray images, then he proposed the project that would become the CT scanner.</p><p>EMI didn’t develop or manufacture medical equipment and wasn’t interested in getting into that line of business, but Hounsfield’s supervisor believed in his idea and approved it. The company couldn’t fully fund the project, so Hounsfield applied for and received a grant of around US $40,000—approximately $300,000 in 2022 figures—from the British <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health-and-social-care" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Health and Social Care</a>.</p><h2>A CT scanner for cow brains and human ones</h2><p>Hounsfield worked with neuroradiologists <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/james-ambrose?lang=us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">James Ambrose</a> and Louis Kreel to build the first prototype. It was small enough to sit atop a table. They tested the machine on small pigs, and after successfully producing images of their brains, the three men built a full-size scanner. </p><p>The CT scanner was first tested on human brains preserved in formalin. But the brains weren’t ideal because the chemical had hardened their tissues so severely that they no longer resembled normal brain matter, as described in <a href="https://jweekly.com/1997/04/25/kosher-cow-brains-help-pioneer-ct-scan-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an article</a> about the scanner in<a href="https://jweekly.com/1997/04/25/kosher-cow-brains-help-pioneer-ct-scan-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://jweekly.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Jewish News of Northern California</em></a>. Because the scanner was intended for use on living patients, Hounsfield and his team looked for a brain similar to a human’s. </p><p>They procured fresh cow brains, but those couldn’t be used because an electric shock was used to stun the animals before they were slaughtered. The procedure caused the brain to fill with blood, and the fluid obstructed the radiologists’ view of the organ’s structure.</p><p>Ambrose, who was part Jewish, suggested using kosher cow brains because instead of being stunned, the animals had their jugular slit. The process drained blood away from the skull—which enabled clear CT scans of the brain.</p><p>After several successful tests, the machine was ready to be tried on a human. The scanner was installed in 1971 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Morley_Hospital" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Atkinson Morley Hospital</a>, in London, where Ambrose worked. The first patient was a woman who showed signs of a brain tumor.</p><p>She lay on a table as X-rays were shot through her skull from a single site above her head. The beams passed through her and struck a crystal detector housed in the gantry below her head. Both the X-ray source and the detector moved around her in 1-degree increments until they had turned 180 degrees, with each device ending up at the other one’s starting point.</p><p>That allowed the scanner to depict the brain in individual layers. Hounsfield described it as putting the brain “through a bacon slicer,” according to <a href="https://www.medmuseum.siemens-healthineers.com/en/stories-from-the-museum/history-of-ct" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an article</a> about the scanner on the <a href="https://www.medmuseum.siemens-healthineers.com/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siemens MedMuseum</a> website.</p><p> The detector recorded the X-ray signals and sent the data to a computer. The computer constructed an image of the brain using physicist<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_McLeod_Cormack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Allan MacLeod Cormack</a>’s algebraic reconstruction technique. The technique built up an image by filling in a matrix, each square of which corresponded to a part of the examined organ, according to a <a href="https://ethw.org/w/images/8/87/The_Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine%2C_1979.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobel news release</a> about the scanner. Because the crystal detector was 100 times more sensitive than X-ray film, the density resolution was much higher, making the resulting image much clearer. Cormack shared the 1979 Nobel Prize with Hounsfield.</p><p>The scan took 30 minutes and the computerized construction of the image took another two hours. The image showed a cystic mass about the size of a plum on the patient’s left frontal lobe.</p><p>EMI began manufacturing CT scanners and sold them to hospitals with success. But within five years, <a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwj_3JbcoY78AhVqDq0GHZToAFMYABAAGgJwdg&sig=AOD64_1cu3PUYHGWQDRwsmgihZ2TP5etsg&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjKn43coY78AhWfHzQIHXNZCJcQ0Qx6BAgHEAE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Electric</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwi2nYDioY78AhWkHH0KHRTnA-0YABACGgJwdg&sig=AOD64_01QYHYaHwj0jNhAUzIX6iCHvk_9g&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjnwfDhoY78AhWjBDQIHWfnA8kQqyQoAXoECAkQBg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siemens</a>, and other companies began making more enhanced, full-body scanners.

While that era of sooty foundries and mills is long past, manufacturing remains essential — and challenging. One promising way to meet modern industrial challenges is by using additive manufacturing (AM) processes, such as powder bed fusion and other emerging techniques. To fulfill its promise of rapid, precise, and customizable production, AM demands more than just a retooling of factory equipment; it also calls for new approaches to factory operation and management.</p><a href="https://cdn.comsol.com/stories/2022/111611/Fig1-English-mills.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Illustration of coal mines and iron works in England, with horse carts, a railroad, and smoking chimneys." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="e3fb28d037b3efb8abe075007f929506" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="040d0" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-coal-mines-and-iron-works-in-england-with-horse-carts-a-railroad-and-smoking-chimneys.jpg?id=32338174&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>That is why Britain’s <a href="https://www.the-mtc.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Manufacturing Technology Centre</a> (MTC) has enhanced its in-house metal powder bed fusion AM facility with a simulation model and app to help factory staff make informed decisions about its operation. The app, built using the Application Builder in the <a href="https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COMSOL Multiphysics</a> software, shows the potential for pairing a full-scale AM factory with a so-called “digital twin” of itself.</p><p>“The model helps predict how heat and humidity inside a powder bed fusion factory may affect product quality and worker safety,” says Adam Holloway, a technology manager within the MTC’s modeling team. “When combined with data feeds from our facility, the app helps us integrate predictive modeling into day-to-day decision-making.” The MTC project demonstrates the benefits of placing simulation directly into the hands of today’s industrial workforce and shows how simulation could help shape the future of manufacturing.</p><p class="pull-quote">“We’re trying to present the findings of some very complex calculations in a simple-to-understand way. By creating an app from our model, we can empower staff to run predictive simulations on laptops during their daily shifts.”<br/>—Adam Holloway, MTC Technology Manager</p><h3>Additive Manufacturing for Aerospace With DRAMA</h3><p>To help modern British factories keep pace with the world, the MTC promotes high-value manufacturing throughout the United Kingdom. The MTC is based in the historic English industrial city of Coventry (Figure 2), but its focus is solely on the future. That is why the team has committed significant human and technical resources to its National Centre for Additive Manufacturing (NCAM).</p><h3></h3><br><img alt="Wide photo of a modern glass and metal building next to a reflecting pool." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="d4363256606e4e0ce9748ac7453e5cf3" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="a7f1b" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/wide-photo-of-a-modern-glass-and-metal-building-next-to-a-reflecting-pool.jpg?id=32338184&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>“Adopting AM is not just about installing new equipment. Our clients are also seeking help with implementing the digital infrastructure that supports AM factory operations,” says Holloway. “Along with enterprise software and data connectivity, we’re exploring how to embed simulation within their systems as well.”</p><p>The NCAM’s Digital Reconfigurable Additive Manufacturing for Aerospace (DRAMA) project provides a valuable venue for this exploration. Developed in concert with numerous manufacturers, the DRAMA initiative includes the new powder bed fusion AM facility mentioned previously. With that mini factory as DRAMA’s stage, Holloway and his fellow simulation specialists play important roles in making its production of AM aerospace components a success.</p><h3>Making Soft Material Add Up to Solid Objects</h3><p>What makes a manufacturing process “additive”, and why are so many industries exploring AM methods? In the broadest sense, an additive process is one where objects are created by adding material layer by layer, rather than removing it or molding it. A reductive or subtractive process for producing a part may, for example, begin with a solid block of metal that is then cut, drilled, and ground into shape. An additive method for making the same part, by contrast, begins with empty space! Loose or soft material is then added to that space (under carefully controlled conditions) until it forms the desired shape. That pliable material must then be solidified into a durable finished part.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Closeup photo of a silver metal part with multiple interconnected links." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="2063f74dddd19f584d51bce6dd665fe1" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="06c05" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/closeup-photo-of-a-silver-metal-part-with-multiple-interconnected-links.jpg?id=32338189&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Different materials demand different methods for generating and solidifying additive forms. For example, common 3D printers sold to consumers produce objects by unspooling warm plastic filament, which bonds to itself and becomes harder as it cools. By contrast, the <a href="https://www.additivemanufacturing.media/articles/am-101-powder-bed-fusion-pbf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">metal powder bed fusion process</a> (Ref. 1) begins with, as its name suggests, a powdered metal which is then melted by applied heat and re-solidified when it cools. A part produced via the metal powder bed fusion process can be seen in Figure 3.</p><h3>How Heat and Humidity Affect Metal Powder Bed Fusion</h3><p>“The market opportunities for AM methods have been understood for a long time, but there have been many obstacles to large-scale adoption,” Holloway says. “Some of these obstacles can be overcome during the design phase of products and AM facilities. Other issues, such as the impact of environmental conditions on AM production, must be addressed while the facility is operating.”</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Microscope photo of metal grains showing gray spheres of different sizes grouped together." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="e670ab0d83b812c7e155cbb27797aba3" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="bd72b" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/microscope-photo-of-metal-grains-showing-gray-spheres-of-different-sizes-grouped-together.jpg?id=32338205&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>For instance, maintaining careful control of heat and humidity is an essential task for the DRAMA team. “The metal powder used for the powder bed fusion process (Figure 4) is highly sensitive to external conditions,” says Holloway. “This means it can begin to oxidize and pick up ambient moisture even while it sits in storage, and those processes will continue as it moves through the facility. Exposure to heat and moisture will change how it flows, how it melts, how it picks up an electric charge, and how it solidifies,” he says. “All of these factors can affect the resulting quality of the parts you’re producing.”</p><p>Careless handling of powdered metal is not just a threat to product quality. It can threaten the health and safety of workers as well. “The metal powder used for AM processes is flammable and toxic, and as it dries out, it becomes even more flammable,” Holloway says. “We need to continuously measure and manage humidity levels, as well as how loose powder propagates throughout the facility.”</p><p>To maintain proper atmospheric conditions, a manufacturer could augment its factory’s ventilation with a full climate control system, but that could be prohibitively expensive. The NCAM estimated that it would cost nearly half a million English pounds to add climate control to its relatively modest facility. But what if they could adequately manage heat and humidity <em>without</em> adding such a complicated system?</p><h3>Responsive Process Management with Multiphysics Modeling</h3><p>Perhaps using multiphysics simulation for careful process management could provide a cost-effective alternative. “As part of the DRAMA program, we created a model of our facility using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) capabilities of the COMSOL software. Our model (Figure 5) uses the finite element method to solve partial differential equations describing heat transfer and fluid flow across the air domain in our facility,” says Holloway. “This enabled us to study how environmental conditions would be affected by multiple variables, from the weather outside, to the number of machines operating, to the way machines were positioned inside the shop. A model that accounts for those variables helps factory staff adjust ventilation and production schedules to optimize conditions,” he explains.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Three screenshots of COMSOL Multiphysics simulation software." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="74cf359696decaaf0e3a445bdf259d36" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="97f15" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-screenshots-of-comsol-multiphysics-simulation-software.jpg?id=32338242&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><h3>A Simulation App that Empowers Factory Staff</h3><p>The DRAMA team made their model more accessible by building a simulation app of it with the Application Builder in <a href="https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COMSOL Multiphysics</a> (Figure 6). “We’re trying to present the findings of some very complex calculations in a simple-to-understand way,” Holloway explains. “By creating an app from our model, we can empower staff to run predictive simulations on laptops during their daily shifts.”</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Screenshot of COMSOL software." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="54211e69bac2daeb0e213dcaa51d2642" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="dff98" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/screenshot-of-comsol-software.png?id=32338271&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Screenshots of COMSOL software." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="ced66d1e1ad71595efbcef9bed9c4704" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="2ed87" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/screenshots-of-comsol-software.jpg?id=32338285&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Two screenshots of COMSOL software." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="8b101c40f20ec997e96686b6c2b2e4f3" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="683cf" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-screenshots-of-comsol-software.jpg?id=32338288&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>The app user can define relevant boundary conditions for the beginning of a factory shift and then make ongoing adjustments. Over the course of a shift, heat and humidity levels will inevitably fluctuate. Perhaps factory staff should alter the production schedule to maintain part quality, or maybe they just need to open doors and windows to improve ventilation. Users can change settings in the app to test the possible effects of actions like these. For example, Figure 8 presents isothermal surface plots that show the effect that opening the AM machines’ build chambers has on air temperature, while Figure 9 shows how airflow is affected by opening the facility doors.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Computer image showing airflow with arrows and colors indicating how air circulates." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="c16006e0919554f47d8a131048113b98" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="4164e" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/computer-image-showing-airflow-with-arrows-and-colors-indicating-how-air-circulates.jpg?id=32338290&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><h3>A Step Toward a “Factory-Level Digital Twin”</h3><p>While the current app is an important step forward, it does still require workers to manually input relevant data. Looking ahead, the DRAMA team envisions something more integral, and therefore, more powerful: a “digital twin” for its AM facility. A digital twin, as described by Ed Fontes in a 2019 post on the <a href="https://www.comsol.com/blogs/digital-twins-not-just-hype/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COMSOL Blog</a> (Ref. 2), is “a dynamic, continuously updated representation of a real physical product, device, or process.” It is important to note that even the most detailed model of a system is not necessarily its digital twin.</p><p>“To make our factory environment model a digital twin, we’d first provide it with ongoing live data from the actual factory,” Holloway explains. “Once our factory model was running in the background, it could adjust its forecasts in response to its data feeds and suggest specific actions based on those forecasts.”</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Diagram showing how physical assets related to their digital twin." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="ab5e5015ff0316329c43a55ba4b3eddc" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="758da" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-showing-how-physical-assets-related-to-their-digital-twin.jpg?id=32338292&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>“We want to integrate our predictive model into a feedback loop that includes the actual factory and its staff. The goal is to have a holistic system that responds to current factory conditions, uses simulation to make predictions about future conditions, and seamlessly makes self-optimizing adjustments based on those predictions,” Holloway says. “Then we could truly say we’ve built a digital twin for our factory.”</p><h3>Simulation at Work on the Factory Floor</h3><p>As an intermediate step toward building a full factory-level digital twin, the DRAMA simulation app has already proven its worth. “Our manufacturing partners may already see how modeling can help with planning an AM facility, but not really understand how it can help with operation,” Holloway says. “We’re showing the value of enabling a line worker to open up the app, enter in a few readings or import sensor data, and then quickly get a meaningful forecast of how a batch of powder will behave that day.”</p><p>Beyond its practical insights for manufacturers, the overall project may offer a broader lesson as well: By pairing its production line with a dynamic simulation model, the DRAMA project has made the entire operation safer, more productive, and more efficient. The DRAMA team has achieved this by deploying the model where it can do the most good — into the hands of the people working on the factory floor.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>References</h3><ol><li>S.

These, of course, are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-05-new-tech-at-ces-history.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">few and far between</a>. We then seek out dramatic changes in existing technology, a new display, say, that will make our old televisions look dim and drab. Spoiler: There was nothing in either category at CES this year. Rather, this year’s CES was, mostly, a year of tweaks of existing products. For example, <a href="https://www.lg.com/us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LG</a> and <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Samsung</a>, the Korean consumer electronics giants, were all about putting different—and in LG’s case, <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2022/09/lgs-new-refrigerator-ready-to-lift-peoples-moods-at-ifa-2022/" target="_blank">electronically changeable</a>—colors on the outside of their refrigerators.</p><p>But consumer electronics isn’t just about big companies or world-changing ideas. Smaller companies can come up with products that make sense in a big way—or at least are intriguing enough to make you want to try them out. Here are four small ideas that may have big legs.</p><h3>Your dog can understand English—so why not help him speak it?</h3><br/><img alt="colorful interlocked padding with buttons" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="dd1bcbef67fc501dce9f029fe455bd43" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="14cb5" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/colorful-interlocked-padding-with-buttons.jpg?id=32765010&width=980"/><p>At first glance <a href="https://fluent.pet/" target="_blank">FluentPet</a> seemed completely bonkers to me—a bunch of interlocking pads and buttons designed to allow your dog to communicate with you in the way you’ll understand: words. But then I remembered some of the gear designed for early experiments in <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/what-studying-primate-communication-tells-us-about-the-evolution-of-human-language" target="_blank">ape communication</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dogs-respond-to-an-average-of-89-unique-words-experiment-finds" target="_blank">recent research</a> demonstrating that the average dog can learn to recognize nearly 100 individual human words. So I stopped a moment to chat with founder Leo Trottier. Trottier says he was working on a Ph.D. in cognitive science when he started developing pet-related technology. His previous startup produced <a href="https://clever.pet/pages/games-and-science" target="_blank">CleverPet</a>, a gadget that played with dogs.</p><p>FluentPet’s device consists of an expandable set of buttons set into connecting foam pads. The pet owner records a word or phrase for each button, ideally one the dog is familiar with—like “play” or “treat.” The owner then shows the dog that pushing the button generates the sound of the word and triggers the owner to produce the object or perform the action. A dog looking to boss its owner around might pick up on this quickly.</p><p>Trottier says that some cats have learned to use the gadget as well, but that’s a dicey proposition, because cats just haven’t evolved to be as interested in communicating with people as dogs are. A US $160 FluentPet set includes the base speaker unit and six buttons.</p><h3>A turntable your Sonos system will love</h3><br/><p>In case you missed the memo, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/arts/music/vinyl-records-delays.html" target="_blank">vinyl records are officially back in style</a>. I’ve seen evidence of this, with my adult children eyeing my old vinyl albums that are gathering dust in a forgotten cabinet. However, my turntable, amplifier, and speakers have long been abandoned for an easy-to-use multiroom Sonos system, so those albums are stuck in purgatory.</p><p>Enter the Victrola Stream turntable, at $599 and $799 (depending on the quality of the stylus and other materials). The company says you just plug the gadget into a power outlet and connection with Sonos is basically seamless. Victrola has me in its target market—those who moved into the Sonos world but couldn’t bear to part with those stacks of vinyl—and I don’t think I’m alone.</p><h3>Audio in a pearl earring</h3><br/><img alt="close up of pearl and gold clip on earring" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="c34ae71195cd3e875913e07c683344b9" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="dc8d0" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-pearl-and-gold-clip-on-earring.jpg?id=32765011&width=980"/><p>One message from CES is that people are getting used to wearing Bluetooth earbuds all day and that this can be a good thing, because these devices can reduce noise, enhance hearing, and connect us to our wearables as well as provide audio for podcasts and phone calls. Those Bluetooth-wearing mavens expect that eventually ubiquity will take away the dork factor.</p><p><a href="https://www.nova-audio.com/" target="_blank">Nova</a> is looking to make Bluetooth earpieces more unobtrusive sooner rather than later by turning them into audio earrings, available as clip-on or pierced. The Nova H1 Audio Earrings are currently priced in Euros, at €595 for silver and €695 for gold. (The pearls, by the way, are real.) Note that these gadgets do not sit in the ear; that’s not a bug, that’s a feature. The company says it allows for better situational awareness.</p><h3>Genetically engineered houseplants for air purification</h3><br/><p>With biotechnology slowly trickling into CES, why not a genetically engineered houseplant on the show floor? <a href="https://neoplants.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neoplant</a>’s Neo P1 is designed to remove formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and xylene from the air; the company says it purifies air 30 times as well as the best of today’s air-cleaning houseplants.</p><p>Neoplant intends to sell live plants in a container engineered to maximize air intake and promises that they aren’t easy to kill. The package of plant and container will list at $179. The company had only seedlings on display; unlike engineers who often work day and night to get a product ready for exhibit, plants don’t do overtime.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 14:57:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ces-2023-gadgets</guid><category>Gadgets</category><category>Wearables</category><category>Bluetooth</category><category>Sonos</category><category>Vinyl records</category><category>Pets</category><category>Consumer electronics</category><dc:creator>Tekla S.

The generations of wireless cellular technology (or the Gs) have been incrementing every 10 years: 1G prior to 1990, 2G in 1990, 3G in 2000, 4G in 2010, and 5G in 2020. We expect 6G to roll out in 2030.</p><p>When the Gs are plotted over time, the data volume increases exponentially and therefore reinforces the need for newer technological platforms. With pun intended, technologists call this <em>broadening</em>, or broader usage of the frequency spectrum.</p><hr/><p>In terms of 6G platform development, a variety of technologies are expected to come together and work in a complementary manner. They include the Internet of Everything (IoE), artificial intelligence (AI), augmented intelligence for cybersecurity, edge computing, next-generation satellites, and the metaverse. The power of data, ubiquitous high-speed communications, and computing coming together in a meaningful manner will further transform all that we do, and the way we live and work.</p><p>The pace of technological development is now swifter than ever, but societal implications often become afterthoughts.</p><p>The <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">17 U.N. Sustainable Development Goals</a> adopted in September 2015 included ones aimed at industry, infrastructure, innovation, energy, education, and partnerships. The SDGs are expected to be accomplished by 2030, coincidently when 6G is anticipated to debut.</p><p>In the lead-up to announcing the SDGs, <a href="https://www.jeffsachs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jeffrey D. Sachs</a>—while he was special advisor to the U.N. secretary-general—proposed in April 2015 an integrated vision for sustainable development. The integrated approach would advance a “<a href="https://sustainability-innovation.asu.edu/media/video/jeffrey-sachs-age-sustainable-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">holistic vision of systems analysis, where we have to understand how natural, technological, and sociopolitical systems interact</a>,” Sachs said.</p><p>For major developments such as 6G, a holistic approach is required.</p><p>A recent example that illustrates the point was the rollout of 5G in 2020. It required the installation of cellphone towers or masts. Because community members did not understand the benefits of the installations or were not sufficiently consulted, several of the towers were not renewed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/technology/coronavirus-5g-uk.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Some even were set on fire.</a> With fast advancements in AI expected thanks to 6G, the fear of technology and what it might or might not do continues to be discussed in many parts of the world.</p><p>So, what needs to be done?</p><ul><li><strong>Establish a<a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2022-12-28-effective-development-of-6g-requires-global-cooperation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> global forum</a> for 6G policy development.</strong> We are reminded of the African proverb “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” In other words, for the holistic approach discussed above, we recommend a partnership of international experts from different disciplinary backgrounds. The United Nations has initiated a <a href="https://www.un.org/en/newtechnologies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strategy on new technologies</a> and provided a road map for cooperation. The strategy provides the thought process that could be adopted for 6G—both internationally and nationally.</li><li>In parallel, <strong>workforce training and development need to be furthered and made inclusive of 6G possibilities. A multidisciplinary approach is required to understand and appreciate the societal implications of 6G</strong>. Embedding the U.N. SDGs in educational programs could be an effective way of cultivating the appropriate mindset. The <a href="https://www.uj.ac.za/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Johannesburg</a>, for example, has made it compulsory for all students to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/UJ4IRleader" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">complete a course</a> on the SDGs and AI. Their training will benefit the public and private sectors.</li><li>Universities are important educational enablers, <strong>and other organizations can assist</strong>. The <a href="https://iln.ieee.org/callApi.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Learning Network</a> is one provider of continuing education.</li><li>Because <strong>inclusivity and diversity</strong> are key ingredients for innovation, this should be on everyone’s agenda and prioritized. In line with such diversity, forums developed should be <strong>inclusive of the private sector</strong>. The private sector constitutes disrupters who can change and are changing technology paradigms. Another key consideration is <strong>gender and intergenerational diversity</strong>. In view of the 2030 time period for 6G, it is essential to have the generations that will be most impacted by the technology in the room.</li><li><strong>Ensure public understanding up front.</strong> It is important to consider the pros and cons of technology and acknowledge that there will be unintended consequences. A prominent public debate emerging is the aspect of job creation versus automation. As with previous industrial or technological revolutions, it is expected that jobs will be created, and some will yield smart sustainable solutions.</li><li>We must <strong>learn from the past and be adaptive to what the future brings</strong>. IEEE has done extensive work on <a href="https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ethically aligned design</a>, which provides sound directions on how societal values can be incorporated, aided by technology, in the way modern technologies are developed.</li></ul><p>While recognizing that that is not an exhaustive list of what needs to be done, we call for a holistic approach to technology development for 6G telecommunications.</p><p><em>The views expressed here are the authors’ own and do not represent positions of </em>IEEE Spectrum<em>, </em>The Institute<em>, or </em><em>IEEE</em><em>.</em></p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 19:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/examining-the-impact-of-6g-telecommunications-on-society</guid><category>Ieee member news</category><category>6g</category><category>5g</category><category>Telecommunications</category><category>U.n. sustainable development goals</category><category>Ieee learning network</category><category>Ethics</category><category>Diversity</category><category>Ethically aligned design</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Saurabh Sinha</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/glowing-letters-that-read-6g-above-an-earth-curvature.jpg?id=32651505&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Bosch Powers the Automotive Sector Toward an Electrified Future</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/bosch-electric-vehicles</link><description><![CDATA[

</p><p>Just as tourists in Paris are drawn to the Louvre, visitors to Stuttgart, Germany, also flock to museums displaying the great works of the city. Stuttgart may not boast of Degas or Monet, but its prominent names are perhaps even more famous than Paris’ painters: Mercedes–Benz and Porsche. Each of these iconic automakers maintains a museum in the southwestern German city they call home. Their gleaming galleries feature many historic and influential cars, almost all of them powered by petroleum-fueled internal combustion (IC) engines. Looking ahead, Stuttgart will likely continue to be the heart of the German auto industry, but how long will the IC engine remain the heart of the automobile?</p><p>Even the most successful manufacturers must adapt to changing conditions. The German automotive sector, along with its global counterparts, is doing so by developing <em>elektrische autos</em>. Electric cars are an important focus of Robert Bosch — another leading automotive company founded in Stuttgart. Today, Bosch supplies electric powertrains, systems, and components to automakers worldwide.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="A three-phase inverter that consists of a metal box with five connectors." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="2578845e63379521a95ed5a02f3de4d6" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="5b46d" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-three-phase-inverter-that-consists-of-a-metal-box-with-five-connectors.jpg?id=32357313&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>As the automotive industry races toward an electrified future, Bosch is accelerating its R&D into the essential building blocks of electric drivetrains. One of these components is the inverter, which changes direct current (DC) from the car’s batteries into alternating current (AC) to power its drive motor (Figure 1). The inverter’s ability to provide a smooth flow of current depends on its integral DC link capacitor (Figure 2). “The capacitor is one of the most expensive components of the inverter. Its performance has a direct impact on the performance and reliability of the inverter, which is fundamental to the operation of the drivetrain,” explains Martin Kessler, Bosch senior expert for automotive electronics.</p><p>For the global automotive sector to meet its ambitious electrification goals, inverters and their capacitors must undergo continuous improvement and optimization. Martin Kessler and his team rely on multiphysics simulation to test and refine Bosch’s DC link capacitors. Their simulation-enabled predictive analysis complements and optimizes the live prototyping of new designs. “It is simply not possible to predict potential problems with testing alone; we need both simulation and prototyping working hand in hand,” says Kessler.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Digital art 3D illustration of a DC link capacitor that consists of a gray rectangular box with two connectors." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="86d96938eb4e6adafd72e86fb50e7886" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="6a032" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/digital-art-3d-illustration-of-a-dc-link-capacitor-that-consists-of-a-gray-rectangular-box-with-two-connectors.jpg?id=32357316&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><h3>The Emerging Era of the Electric Automobile</h3><p>
	“Drivers, start your engines!” As if heeding the call to begin a worldwide race, people everywhere begin their days by firing up a rumbling IC engine. But this familiar sound can seem ominous, especially as the environmental impact of vehicle emissions grows more apparent. To lessen these emissions and their contribution to global climate change, the automobile industry is ramping up the production of electric-powered cars and trucks. Many of the electric vehicles available today have familiar brand names, but under the hood, these cars often rely on the technology and expertise of outside suppliers.
</p><p>
	It is worth noting just how significant a shift this is for a major global industry. Leading automakers are some of the world’s largest employers, and a vast share of their workers, R&D, and production capacity is dedicated to producing IC engines. The centrality of internal combustion to these companies can be found in their names, from General Motors to Bayerische Motoren Werke (better known as BMW). Why would companies known for their engines turn to outsiders to make their cars go? Perhaps it is because, in a sense, electrification is forcing the industry to learn how to produce an entirely different type of machine.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Digital art 3D schematic showing a transparent car with the electric engine connected to batteries." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="e6d1a3b4de970f7c42aa2a86445bd1a9" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="06994" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/digital-art-3d-schematic-showing-a-transparent-car-with-the-electric-engine-connected-to-batteries.jpg?id=32357317&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><h3>Anatomy of an Electric Drivetrain</h3><p>
	To make a fully electric car, it is not enough to replace the engine with an electric motor and the gas tank with a battery. Such familiar devices are only parts of a larger system, which helps deliver smooth, reliable performance by adjusting to the constantly varying conditions under which every vehicle must operate (Figure 3).
</p><h3>Indispensable Inverter, Crucial Capacitor</h3><p>
	The role of the inverter in an automotive drivetrain is simple in concept, but complex in practice. The inverter must satisfy the AC demands of the motor with the DC provided by the battery, but it must also adjust to ongoing fluctuations in load, charge, temperature, and other factors that can affect the behavior of each part of the system. All of this must occur within tight cost and spatial constraints, and the component must sustain this performance for years to come.
</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Diagram showing an electrical circuit schematic and the electrical current plotted at two places in the circuit." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="89b1ba617e0652efec04b9e30cac0b8e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="0e318" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-showing-an-electrical-circuit-schematic-and-the-electrical-current-plotted-at-two-places-in-the-circuit.jpg?id=32357322&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>To understand the inverter’s function, consider what a three-phase AC motor needs in order to operate. If connected to DC, the motor simply will not rotate. Instead, it must be provided with alternating current with three distinct but complementary waveforms, enabling the motor’s three-part field coil to magnetically attract the segments of its rotor in a sequential pattern. “To control the activity of the motor, we must control the amplitude and frequency of the inverter’s current output,” explains Kessler. “The speed of the motor is proportional to frequency, while amplitude helps determine its torque.”</p><p>“The desired current waveform through the transistors has a relatively steep gradient. The only way to achieve switch-mode current with this high gradient is to have very low inductance in the source path,” Kessler says. Inductance is the particular force opposing changes in current flow. Every slight change in current will be limited by an induced counteracting voltage, which will disrupt the desired waveform — and the smooth rotation of the motor.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Illustration of the DC link capacitor, which consists of metallic film wound into a canister shape." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="00647ed9fb70910e04106309df8a3774" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="835fa" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-the-dc-link-capacitor-which-consists-of-metallic-film-wound-into-a-canister-shape.jpg?id=32357324&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>To reduce the inductance in the source path of the transistors, a capacitor is placed in parallel across the input lead from the battery, which is called the DC link. The DC link capacitor (Figure 5) is placed in direct proximity to the transistors and provides the desired current waveforms through the transistors. The low impedance of the capacitor minimizes any remaining ripple voltage on the battery side.</p><p>A typical capacitor consists of two electrodes separated by an insulating gap, which may simply be airspace or some kind of material. In this application, Bosch uses capacitors made with metallized polypropylene film. A thin coating of metal (forming the electrodes) is sprayed on each side of the film, which provides the necessary dielectric gap. The metallized film is then wound tightly into a canister shape. As with the inverter itself, the capacitor’s conceptual simplicity conceals a multifaceted engineering design problem.</p><h3>Challenges with DC Link Capacitor Design for Vehicle Inverters</h3><p>Capacitors are widely available components that are installed in countless electronic devices. For the past seven years, Martin Kessler has been responsible for DC link capacitor design at Bosch. He has been with the company since 1989 and has worked on electric car technology since 2010. That such an experienced engineer is dedicated to this one component shows its importance — and its complexity.</p><p>“Why can we not just pick up a capacitor from the marketplace?” asks Kessler, rhetorically. “There are multiple interdependent factors at work. First, we have high demands for performance and reliability. Second, there are very tight spatial requirements. Third, we face difficult thermal constraints, as the polypropylene film in a capacitor can only withstand temperatures up to around 105°C. This issue is compounded by the interaction of electromagnetic and thermal activity throughout the inverter. And finally, the capacitor is relatively expensive,” Kessler explains.</p><h3>Simulation (Not Luck) Helps Solve the Black Box Problem</h3><p>To meet the design challenges of a DC link capacitor, Kessler developed a process that combines experimental testing with multiphysics simulation. As an example of why simulation-based analysis is a necessary part of his work, he cites the difficulty of finding and measuring potential hot spots, where high heat and coupled effects can cause failures. “We try to locate hot spots by placing a lot of thermocouples inside prototypes and measuring temperatures at various load points,” Kessler says. “But my mantra is that you will never find a hot spot like this without a lot of luck! You will need to be lucky to place the thermocouple in the right position,” he laughs.</p><p>“A simple 2D model of a capacitor is also insufficient,” Kessler continues. “The inverter is a distributed system with internal resonances and a complex loss distribution. Our coupled EM and thermal analysis must account for skin effects and proximity effects. We cannot calculate an absolute value for peak temperatures without a 3D finite element approach, which also enables us to model the spatial distribution of coupled EM and thermal effects. This is an ideal task for the COMSOL Multiphysics software,” Kessler says. (Figures 6–7)</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="3D model of the electromagnetic behavior inside a DC link capacitor, with some areas more active than others." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="05eaa39968bfda0d9344e1fdccbef83b" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="a8e69" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-model-of-the-electromagnetic-behavior-inside-a-dc-link-capacitor-with-some-areas-more-active-than-others.jpg?id=32357339&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><img alt="3D model of the electromagnetic field around the DC link capacitor." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="d73eea330d276cf314811b26d672e0fd" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="e2a15" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-model-of-the-electromagnetic-field-around-the-dc-link-capacitor.jpg?id=32357329&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Kessler’s design process validates simulation models against measured results, where possible, and then uses the validated models to pinpoint potential problems (Figure 8). “By helping us locate hot spots in the model, the simulation helps us avoid issues that would have appeared late in the development process, or even after production had started,” says Kessler. “Instead, we can get specific results and make adjustments early in the process.”</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="3D model of computer simulation of the thermal effects inside the DC link capacitor." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="2ead5f010e8bd11bd52b1bae8f720d46" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="a30e1" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-model-of-computer-simulation-of-the-thermal-effects-inside-the-dc-link-capacitor.jpg?id=32357340&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>“We perform EM modeling and validation of every new design. We compare the calculated equivalent series resistance (ESR) curve with the ESR curve as measured from a prototype (Figure 9). If these curves are aligned, we can set up boundary conditions for stationary and transient heat calculations,” says Kessler. “We can compare the temperature curves from our thermocouples with the results of probes in the COMSOL Multiphysics model. If they match, we can then simulate all the critical points where we must keep temperatures within limits.” The curve data is put into the COMSOL Multiphysics software via the LiveLink <em>for</em> MATLAB interfacing product.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Plot showing the ESR curve comparing calculated values with simulated values, which match closely." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="99edf481100c7d0312087530849c86a9" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="cce95" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/plot-showing-the-esr-curve-comparing-calculated-values-with-simulated-values-which-match-closely.jpg?id=32357341&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>“Before we can do this, we have to think about which factors should be incorporated into the model,” says Kessler. “Some of the variables we receive from the OEM, such as maximum DC link voltage, are not very relevant to our simulation,” he continues. “But the current, switching frequency, e-machine values, and modulation schemes all help define a current spectrum. We need to calculate the current spectrum for all three phases of our output in order to establish power losses. Once we have this, we can do the harmonic analysis with COMSOL Multiphysics for the frequencies of the current spectrum. Then we sum up our losses for every harmonic,” Kessler explains.</p><p>Other important values include the boundary conditions, which help Kessler and his team determine coupled effects. “We calculate parasitic inductance of the capacitor with the AC/DC Module,” Kessler says. “We also find the complete AC loss distribution through the capacitor windings or internal busbar. Then we can couple the results and determine a temperature-dependent resistivity of the cover parts with the Heat Transfer Module,” he says. “This enables us to establish the maximum element hot spot temperature resulting from the EM activity.”</p><p>Findings from their analyses can then lead to design changes. Kessler explains that each new capacitor design typically undergoes three rounds of testing. “With simulation, the improvement curve gradient is much steeper from one phase to the next. Our knowledge grows quickly, and this is reflected in the final product.” The latest generation of Bosch inverters promises 6 percent greater range and a 200 percent jump in power density compared to previous designs.</p><h3>Electrification Shifts into High Gear</h3><p>As automakers convert more of their product lines to electric propulsion, Martin Kessler believes that the need for rapid, cost-conscious R&D will also increase. “Electric mobility is growing up now,” he says. “We expect that the OEMs will come to us with more varied needs, for inverters in different power classes and that meet tighter spatial constraints,” says Kessler. “I do think that the number of products that require new capacitor designs will keep expanding. With our simulation-driven development methods, we are confident that we can keep up with this growth.”</p><p>In the years to come, perhaps visitors to Stuttgart’s car museums will stop to admire the historic motors and inverters that powered the industry into a new electric age.</p><p><em>MATLAB is a registered trademark of The MathWorks, Inc.</em></p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 15:21:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/bosch-electric-vehicles</guid><category>Electric vehicles</category><category>Power supplies</category><category>Bosch</category><category>Inverters</category><category>Capacitors</category><category>Comsol</category><category>Multiphysics</category><category>Simulation</category><dc:creator>Alan Petrillo</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/digital-art-showing-a-3d-transparent-car-with-the-electric-engine-connected-to-batteries.png?id=32357350&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>BMW’s iVision Dee Brings Sci-fi to the Driveway</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/sci-fi-cars</link><description><![CDATA[

But then the electric BMW began changing colors and facial expressions, talking at me in intimate detail, splashing a digital avatar of my face on its side window, and filling its windshield with head-up display (HUD) projections worthy of <em>Minority Report.</em></p><p>The “Dee” in this radical concept sedan stands for “Digital Emotional Experience.” That includes its eponymous, sultry-voiced virtual assistant. The body’s 240 laser-cut, Kindle-style <a data-linked-post="2656435247" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-e-ink-developed-full-color-epaper" target="_blank">“e-ink” panels</a> let the BMW transform instantly to one of 32 exterior colors. Excited by low current—15 volts and less than 100 milliamperes—the panels’ microencapsulated particles create a moveable e-paper display. Feeling hot pink today? Go for it. And don’t worry about dinging the electric driving range: The chameleonic material uses nominal energy, and only while it’s shifting color to another shade.</p><p> In place of the overwrought double-kidney grilles that have sparked controversy on some recent Bimmers, the iVision’s face is a blank canvas for a variety of shapes or animations. The iVision can track a person’s approach to communicate via “phygital” icons that mimic human expressions such as joy or astonishment. Think Pixar’s anthropomorphic “Cars” come to life, minus the guzzling V-8 favored by Lightning McQueen.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">This illustration of the BMW iVision Dee’s interior shows how heavily it relies on voice assistant input and head-up display (HUD) output to the driver. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">BMW</small></p><p>Inside, the BMW is just as daring. This handsomely minimal sedan eschews the ever-larger screens of Mercedes, Tesla, and other models. Instead, toggling a “Mixed Reality Slider” fills increasing portions of the windshield with driver information, navigation overlays, and other artificial-reality displays. Crank the slider to Stage Five and the entire windshield becomes a virtual world, with BMW seeing possibilities in training simulations or games that let people drive real cars through an uncannily immersive digital realm. Or recline the seats and watch the <em>Avatar</em> sequel. Once in motion, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse says the company’s HUDs are far better than screens at preventing distraction and keeping the driver’s eyes on the road.</p><p>Kai Langer, head of BMW iDesign, suggests eliminating today’s screens can allow BMW to reserve dashboard space for genuine luxury and rich materials, rather than unsightly, man-cave-size screens that are the antithesis of high design.</p><p>Yet below the color-shifting surface and whimsical features lies a deadly serious car, whose technology will be critical to BMW’s goal of making 50 percent of its global output EVs by 2030. The iVision is strictly a concept car, but it rides on the eagerly awaited Neue Klasse platform. That sophisticated new architecture is set to arrive in 2025, likely kicking off with electrified versions of the blue-chip 3-Series sedan and a small crossover SUV.</p><p>Today’s electric BMWs work hard to top 480 kilometers (300 miles) of driving range. BMW says its Neue Klasse models will travel about 30 percent farther, putting 640 km (400 miles) within reach. First, BMW is switching its familiar prismatic batteries for the kind of large-format cylindrical cells that Tesla seeks to pioneer with its “4680” cells. (Those cells are named for their 46-x-80-millimeter dimensions.) BMW’s sixth-generation EV batteries are even taller and pack more active battery material inside, in either “4690” and “46120” sizes. They’ll be built in tandem with the Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. and other battery partners. BMW battery engineers said the cells pack in 10 percent more active battery material versus its prismatic units, and boost energy density by 20 percent. An improved nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) chemistry reduces cathode levels of pricey, ethically suspect cobalt by 50 percent. Anodes trim graphite content by 20 percent. With 40 percent of the cost of every BMW EV tied up in batteries, the new cells should cut BMW’s battery costs by 50 percent at the pack level. On the environmental front, BMW claims the cells will trim lifetime carbon-dioxide emissions by 60 percent.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">BMW’s sixth-generation EV batteries shift from a rectangular-shaped prismatic cell [left] to the cylindrical [right], which the company says boosts energy density by 20 percent and reduces lifetime carbon-dioxide emissions by 60 percent. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">BMW</small></p><p>Impatient drivers and passengers will appreciate the robust 800-volt architecture—on par with models from Porsche, Hyundai, Kia, and Lucid—that allows charging at well over 200 kilowatts, at least 30 percent faster than today’s models. A leading-edge “pack to open body” design uses the entire pack as a weight-bearing structural member, saving more space and weight.</p><p>Pack sizes will range from 75 kilowatt-hours to a beefy 150 kWh, with motors cranking out anywhere from 268 horsepower to a dizzying 1,341 horsepower, enough to challenge any Tesla Model S Plaid or Lucid Air. Compared with more-volatile prismatic cells, these heat-shielded cylindrical cells can be individually monitored and isolated to avoid thermal runaway. In contrast with current BMWs, the modular design doesn’t require removing the pack to access electronic controls; executives cite those controls as the leading culprit in BMW EV maintenance issues. In keeping with a global trend, the Neue Klasse design will also support lower-cost, ultradurable LFP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery" target="_blank">lithium iron phosphate</a>) batteries in more-affordable BMW Group models. </p><p>While Tesla continues to struggle to bring its large-format cells to production, BMW is confident it can scale up for the showroom. A <a href="https://worldbatterynews.com/bmw-to-build-pilot-battery-cell-plant-in-germany-p381-165.htm" target="_blank">pilot plant in Parsdorf, Germany</a>, is slated to start production in the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>The company further promises 40 percent cuts in carbon emissions throughout the cars’ life cycle, including from battery factories that target 100 percent carbon-neutral production, fed by renewable local electricity. BMW’s ambitious plans call for six new cylindrical-cell-battery factories around the world, with two each in North America, Europe, and China, and at least 120 gigawatt-hours of new capacity. An US $810 million battery factory will spring up in South Carolina, in partnership with Japan’s Envision AESC. BMW is designing that 30-GWh factory to run entirely on carbon-free energy. The batteries will then power EVs from the nearby Spartanburg factory that’s the largest in BMW’s global empire. BMW foresees Spartanburg churning out a half-dozen new EV models by 2030—a virtual competitive necessity thanks to President Biden’s bipartisan <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/" target="_blank">infrastructure law</a>, which limits consumer and automaker tax breaks to cars, batteries, and even battery materials sourced from the United States or its free-trade partners.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 14:00:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/sci-fi-cars</guid><category>Electric vehicles</category><category>Bmw</category><category>E-ink</category><category>Virtual assistants</category><category>Concept car</category><dc:creator>Lawrence Ulrich</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/group-of-four-images-of-cars-each-the-same-car-but-colored-and-patterned-differently.jpg?id=32644894&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>The EV Transition Explained: Policy Roadblocks</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-ev-transition-explained-2658797681</link><description><![CDATA[

	“Public policy implementation is hard even if everyone supports a policy,” says <a href="https://umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/john-leslie-king" target="_blank">professor emeritus John Leslie King</a>, who has studied policy management and administration for decades.<br/>
</p><p>
	It becomes infinitely harder when the technology is complex and depends on several other equally complex technologies; where the stakes are huge; where there is a myriad of players involved each with competing missions, interests and policy-making boundaries to protect; and when time is short.
</p><hr/><div class="ieee-sidebar-medium">
<h2>The EV Transition Explained</h2>
<p>
		This is the eighth in a 
		<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/the-ev-transition-explained/" target="_self">series of articles</a> exploring the major technological and social challenges that must be addressed as we move from vehicles with internal-combustion engines to electric vehicles at scale. In reviewing each article, readers should bear in mind Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman’s admonition: “For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.”
	</p>
</div><p>
	Such is the case with the Biden Administration’s attempted <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-ev-transition-explained-2658797652" target="_self">transition of the U.S. economy</a> away from dependence on fossil fuels like petroleum, coal and natural gas to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035. Driving that timeline is the shift to electric vehicles, which the Administration wants to account for 50 percent of all new cars sold by 2030.<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/07/30/biden-calls-100-percent-clean-electricity-by-2035-heres-how-far-we-have-go/" target="_blank"></a>
</p><p>
	Implementing an EV national policy that aims to transform the economy is an exercise in mind-boggling complexity. Not only are several federal departments and agencies directly involved, including the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Departments of Agriculture</a>, <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Commerce</a>, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Energy</a>, <a href="https://www.doi.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Interior</a>, <a href="https://www.dol.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Labor</a>, <a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Transportation</a>, the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Small Business Administration</a>, the <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Regulatory Commission</a> and the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Trade Commission</a>, but the different and often competing policy objectives and statutory regulations covering multiple industries must be coordinated, agreed and implemented across all 50 state governments, some 3,000 local counties, and 19,000 municipalities.
</p><p>
	The US electrical power industry alone “is influenced by a variety of decision-makers, including over 200 investor-owned utilities, 10 federal power authorities, over 2000 publicly-owned utilities, about 900 rural electric cooperatives, seven RTOs [<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/power-sales-and-markets/rtos-and-isos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Regional Transmission Organizations</a>], 48 state regulatory bodies [e.g., Public Utility Commissions (PUCs)] and many state and federal agencies,” states a <a href="https://cleanenergygrid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Macro-Grids-in-the-Mainstream-1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> by the non-profit group <a href="https://cleanenergygrid.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Americans for a Clean Energy Grid</a>. Reproduce that across the numerous EV-involved industries from mining to recycling and the complexity involved becomes clearer.
</p><p class="pull-quote">
	By 2050, as many as 1 million circuit miles of new transmission lines may be needed, with some 140,000 miles required just for the replacement of existing aging transmission lines.
</p><p>
	Typically, each of governmental body has some number of elected, appointed and full-time staff which can affect how well, or even whether, a policy is implemented. State PUCs, for instance, have a major role in ensuring the electrical infrastructure needed to support EVs exists. Affordability is expected to be just one highly contentious issue: Who, exactly, is going to pay for grid upgrades? In Kansas, the average customer <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/11/20/as-utilities-spend-billions-on-transmission-support-builds-for-independent-monitoring/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid</a> $4 per month on their utility bill for transmission costs 10 years ago, but that has climbed to $20 per month today, and is likely to go higher as billions are spent on new transmission lines to support renewable energy. Increasing electricity rates is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/business/energy-environment/high-electric-bills-summer.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">politically fraught</a> for elected members of public utility commissions. The fight over <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/09/28/gas-station-owners-charging-companies-oppose-xcel-energys-electric-vehicle-charging-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how to fairly implement EV charging networks in Minnesota</a> is another example of the tricky politics PUCs are involved with.
</p><p>
	Tricky politics are one thing; having enough expertise on hand to accomplish policy goals is another altogether. Utility commissioners and their staffs are now dealing with “rising workloads with limited staff, limited resources, and growing gaps in internal expertise due to the increasingly specialized needs of today’s energy system,” <a href="https://rmi.org/people-are-the-most-important-part-of-regulation-in-the-decisive-decade/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=spark&utm_content=spark&utm_campaign=2022_01_27" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">states</a> the <a href="https://rmi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rocky Mountain Institute</a>. In addition, the lack of relevant legal or industry expertise is increasingly worrisome. This may become a major operational and legal problem at the federal level as <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-to-implement-the-climate-law-go-on-hiring-spree/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thousands of new employees are hired</a> across multiple federal departments and agencies to carry out the Biden Administration’s environmental policies.
</p><h2>Staggering amount of new transmission lines needed</h2><p>
	A consequence of the multitude of constituencies involved is that the “decision friction”<strong> </strong>involved in getting any decision approved is white hot. To cool it down requires coordinated communications and joint action among all the participants involved. Given the increased future dependency on renewables, the grid as a whole needs to be much more <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/biden-decarbonization-goals-could-triple-reliance-on-electricity-grid-epri/617188/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reliable and flexible</a> than it is today. How to achieve that still requires quite a bit of research, <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2021/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-achieving-a-national-scale-100-renewable-electric-grid.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> (NREL).
</p><p>
	Yet, as noted in a <a href="https://www.catf.us/about/" target="_blank">Clean Air Task Force</a> <a href="https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/21092114/CATF-Clean-Energy-Infrastructure-Report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>, “To date … there has been hardly any conversation among policy analysts, let alone high-level policymakers, about how such a massive [energy] infrastructure initiative should be undertaken.” When there is conversation, it is <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/states-balk-at-permitting-plans-national-interest-power-lines" target="_blank">frequently combative</a>, with local, state and federal officials fighting among themselves over who has the final say on what is going to be done, where and when.
</p><p>
	To have any hope of reaching a carbon-free electricity grid, tens of thousands of miles of new transmission lines must be added by 2030 to add the existing <a href="https://www.nae.edu/183133/The-US-Electric-Power-System-Infrastructure-and-Its-Vulnerabilities" target="_blank">640,000 circuit miles</a> of alternating current (AC) transmission lines (240,000 operating at more than 230 kilovolts). By 2050, as many as <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/challenges-decarbonizing-us-electric-grid-2035" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1 million circuit miles</a> of new transmission lines may be needed, with some 140,000 miles required just for the<a href="https://www.marshmclennan.com/insights/publications/2020/apr/modernising-ageing-transmission.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> replacement of existing aging transmission lines</a>.
</p><p>
	Unfortunately, between 2010 and 2020, only 18,000 miles of new transmission lines were added to the US grid. Worse, in 2021, just 386 miles were added, according to the American Clean Power (ACP) organization’s <a href="https://cleanpower.org/market-report-2021/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Annual Market Report</a>. The ACP report further notes that “only 5,000 miles is on-track for delivery between now and 2025.”
</p><p>
	The proximate causes for the slow installation of transmission lines are the numerous competing <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/Planning%20Electric%20Transmission%20Lines--A%20Review%20of%20Recent%20Regional%20Transmission%20Plans.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal and state interagency statutory requirements</a> that must be followed. As a result, new transmission line projects take a decade or more to complete and often double or more in cost, <a href="https://www.columbiagorgenews.com/archive/bpa-power-line-plan-dropped/article_32ae3235-91a3-5360-ab87-a5247719943f.html#:~:text=PORTLAND%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20Plans%20for,Administration%20said%20Thursday%2C%20May%2018." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">if they get built at all</a>. The longer the transmission line, generally the <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/challenges-decarbonizing-us-electric-grid-2035" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more time</a> it takes to overcome all the statutory hurdles as well as possible landowner objections.
</p><p class="pull-quote">
	“[T]here has been hardly any conversation among policy analysts, let alone high-level policymakers, about how such a massive [energy] infrastructure initiative should be undertaken.”  —Clean Air Task Force
</p><p>
	Take the <a href="https://patternenergy.com/projects/sunzia-transmission/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SunZia transmission line project</a> which was started in 2006 to send enough renewable power via transmission lines 520 miles across federal, state and private lands between New Mexico and central Arizona. If no final hurdles appear, that project might begin construction in 2023 and be completed in 2025. The <a href="https://www.blm.gov" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">US Bureau of Land Management</a> (BLM) alone spent more than six years <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/planning-and-nepa/plans-in-development/new-mexico/proposed-sunzia-transmission-project#:~:text=The%20proposed%20SunZia%20Southwest%20Transmission,New%20Mexico%20and%20central%20Arizona." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reviewing the project</a>. This does not include the numerous other reviews performed by individual state regulators, other regulatory stakeholders, and public entities. The project owners also had to strike multiple deals with the private landowners to run the lines through their properties.
</p><p>
	Every major transmission line project in the US faces similar challenges to overcome. The public backlash over <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/embattled-maine-power-line-foreshadows-u-s-climate-obstacles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the proposed transmission line across Maine</a> and the recently canceled <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2019/03/01/smud-cancels-expensive-high-voltage-line-project.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">California Colusa-Sutter Transmission Line Project</a> illustrate the  contentious issues involved. With many more transmission lines needed to support renewable energy projects, the public fights are expected to get even more cantankerous.
</p><p>
	It is little wonder that <a href="https://www.aceee.org/about/aceee-staff/alison-silverstein" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alison Silverstein</a>, a former senior adviser to the U.S. <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-renewables-electric-grid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exclaimed</a> in regard to getting energy infrastructure built, “The politics are a freakin’ nightmare.”
</p><h2>Nightmares for everyone</h2><p>
	The same kinds of political and legal nightmares are replicated for every other EV infrastructure challenge. That includes gaining the necessary mining permits for the critical minerals needed for EVs. Both Ford and Rivian are <a href="https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/ford-rivian-urge-faster-permitting-process-critical-ev-minerals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushing</a> the US Department of the Interior to speed up mining permits in the U.S. and limit the permitting process to last no more than three years, like in Canada and Australia. Currently, permitting takes up to ten years in the United States. Even after <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2022/02/25/state-issues-environmental-permits-controversial-nevada-lithium-mine/6898948001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permits have been approved</a>, however, there is no guarantee that a mine will become fully operational, as <a href="https://www.lithiumamericas.com/usa/thacker-pass/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nevada’s Thacker Pass</a> lithium mine’s <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2022/09/13/endangered-status-sought-snail-near-nevada-lithium-mine/10366425002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ongoing controversy</a> shows.
</p><p>
	Permitting issues also bedevil wind power projects. For example, Iowa is one of the best states for wind power farms. In 2021, Iowa <a href="https://cleangridalliance.org/blog/148/iowas-clean-energy-leadership-is-paying-off#:~:text=Iowa%20gets%20over%2055%20percent,being%20paid%20to%20rural%20landowners." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">generated</a> over 55 percent of its electricity from wind power, a larger share than any other state. However, as wind turbine farms have increased, so has local opposition to them. As a result, 49 percent of potential Iowa wind turbine sites <a href="https://clearpath.org/reports/hawkeye-state-headwinds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are no longer available</a>. In addition, there is also strong opposition to building the high-voltage transmission lines needed to connect wind farms to the <a href="https://www.misoenergy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Midcontinent Independent System Operator</a> (MISO) and <a href="https://www.spp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Southwest Power Pool</a> (SPP) grids. Public opposition to wind turbine projects is growing in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio as well.

	“EVs are part of a larger system that involves the electric grid, mining, and so on, increasing dramatically the regulatory scale involved.”  —Lee Vinsel
</p><h2></h2><p>
	Yet even when a popular EV-friendly policy is passed, that doesn’t not mean it will be implemented without difficulty. For instance, seven years ago, California passed a state law <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/ev-charger-installations-in-california-are-bogged-down-by-local-permitting" target="_blank">streamlining EV charging-station permitting</a>. However, the law is widely ignored by local jurisdictions who want to have their own say. This helps explain why California is next to last for the time it takes to get a permit for a direct-current fast charger approved. Equally, the state has long had a subsidy plan to help low-income residents buy EVs. Unfortunately, applications for the subsidies take months to get approved if they are at all. The fund <a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/2022/08/california-electric-cars-rebates/" target="_blank">often runs out of money</a>, discouraging future EV purchasers
</p><p>
	Making policy implementation harder still is that some regulatory bodies assume that other regulatory bodies will implement their policy for them. For instance, the California Air Resource Board, in setting the state’s 2025, 2030 and 2035 EV sales mandates, assumed that the California Public Utilities Commission would be able to mandate the requisite EV-supporting electrical infrastructure. As one CARB member has <a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/2022/06/california-climate-plan-electricity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stated</a>, their concern is climate, whereas solving power generation is the responsibility of the CPUC.

</p><p>
	This highlights something that seems to be a critical weakness in EV policy making, says <a href="https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-science-technology-and-society/faculty/lee-vinsel.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lee Vinsel</a>, a Virginia Polytechnic Institute technology historian, and expert on how regulatory policy has improved auto safety and lowered pollution. Historically, auto regulation has dealt with “the negative externalities associated with the auto itself,” he explained. “Issues like auto safety and pollution were the chief concerns. These issues are self-contained to the auto itself.”
</p><p>
	However, Vinsel points out that with EVs “the negative externalities are generally outside the auto. EVs are part of a larger system that involves the electric grid, mining, and so on, increasing dramatically the regulatory scale involved.”
</p><p>
	It is not surprising, therefore, that <a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/about/our-team/john-bozzella" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John Bozzella</a>, president of the industry trade group <a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alliance for Automotive Innovation Leads</a>, questions the feasibility of California’s mandates. “Whether or not these requirements are realistic or achievable is directly linked to external factors like inflation, charging and fuel infrastructure, supply chains, labor, critical mineral availability and pricing, and the ongoing semiconductor shortage,” Bozzella <a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/posts/press-release/auto-innovators-statement-on-california-zero-emission-vehicle-mandate" target="_blank">says</a>. “These are complex, intertwined and global issues well beyond the control of either CARB or the auto industry.”
</p><p>
	Vinsel further notes, “Successful regulation is fragile.” It depends acutely, he says, upon the government possessing “reliable knowledge, substantial expertise, and organizational capabilities.” EVs are a different regulatory beast from ICE vehicle regulation, needing regulatory expertise that may not exist across government at the depth and breadth needed across so many different industries, Vinsel observes.
</p><p>
	As a result, Vinsel warns, “I do think there are real social risks if the government messes this transition up.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>In the next articles of this series exploring transition to EVs at scale, a topic that has been scarcely studied but will act to exacerbate or reduce EV-related social risks, namely, who will become the winners and losers in the transition to EVs, will be explored.</em>

<strong>The group of well-dressed </strong>young men who gathered on the outskirts of Baltimore on the night of 5 January 2021 hardly looked like extremists. But the next day, prosecutors allege, they would all breach the United States Capitol during the deadly insurrection. Several would loot and destroy media equipment, and one would assault a policeman.
</p><p>
	No strangers to protest, the men, members of the America First movement, diligently donned masks to obscure their faces. None boasted of their exploits on social media, and none of their friends or family would come forward to denounce them. But on 5 January, they made one piping hot, family-size mistake: They shared a pizza.

</div><h3></h3><br/><p>According to charging documents, at 10:57 that evening, a PayPal account registered to a Gmail address paid US $84.72 to Domino’s Pizza in Arbutus, Md. Minutes later, that email account received Venmo payments from users called Thomas Carey, Gabe Chase, and Jon Lizak. A separate Venmo email showed a payment from “Broseph Broseph,” a nickname of another friend, Joseph Brody.</p><p>After the horrific events of the next day, the Federal Bureau of Investigation swung into action. It served cell service and tech companies with geofence warrants—search warrants demanding details on every device and app active within a specified geographic area. One of these warrants, served on Google and covering the interior of the Capitol, showed that a device associated with the Gmail account in question entered the Senate Wing door at 2:18 p.m. on 6 January.</p><p>Connecting that Gmail account to a phone number and then to its owner, Paul Lovley of Halethorpe, Md., was just a matter of a few keystrokes on law-enforcement databases. All that remained was for an FBI agent on stakeout to observe Lovley taking out the trash one night and match his photo to one of a figure captured by Senate surveillance cameras during the riot. Lovley and his four compatriots were charged with a range of federal crimes in September 2022.</p><p>The riot was an unprecedented attack on American democracy, with thousands of citizens, most of them previously unknown to federal investigators, violently storming the seat of government. The resulting investigations were the largest in U.S. history, offering a snapshot of the rapidly evolving nature of law enforcement and how heavily it now relies on data provided, wittingly or not, by suspects themselves.</p><p>While it might seem as though the Capitol-riot investigations represent state-of-the-art digital forensics, “those surveillance technologies are being used in even minor low-level criminal cases across the country every single day,” says Jennifer Lynch, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). “The FBI did not use anything new. They just used it at a much larger scale.”</p><p><em>IEEE Spectrum</em> analyzed hundreds of criminal complaints and other legal filings from the Capitol attacks to understand that reach and scale, and to consider the legal and social consequences of the government’s power to delve into its citizens’ digital lives. That power might seem reassuring when applied to a mob intent on overturning a presidential election, but perhaps less so when brought to bear on people protesting, say, human-rights violations.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Social media provides clues for digital forensics</h2><p>Police work has always involved the connecting of dots, whether photos, phone calls, testimony, or physical evidence. The 6 January investigation showed the power of seeking the digital connections between those dots.</p><p>Over the past two years, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Program on Extremism at George Washington University have made available thousands of legal documents about those charged in connection with the 6 January riot. <em>Spectrum</em> analyzed all those containing details of how alleged perpetrators were identified and investigated: 884 individuals by mid-December. Many were identified using time-honored techniques: Wanted posters remain a powerful tool, these days reaching a global audience via news organizations, the FBI’s website, and social media. Nearly two-thirds of all those people were first identified via tips from witnesses, friends, family, and other human sources. The FBI ultimately received more than 300,000 such tips.</p><p>But the ways in which those sources spotted the alleged perpetrators have changed enormously. Only a tiny fraction of sources were on the ground in Washington, D.C., on 6 January. And although some suspects were recognized in TV reports or news stories, most were spotted on social media.</p><h3></h3><br/><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12220298?672664"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><h3></h3><br/><p>In almost two-thirds of the cases, evidence was cited from one or more social-media platforms. Facebook appeared in almost half of all cases, cited 388 times, followed by Instagram and Twitter with a combined total of 188 mentions. But almost every major social-media app was mentioned in at least one case: LinkedIn, MeWe, Parler, Signal, Snapchat, Telegram, TikTok, even dating app Bumble and shopping-focused Pinterest.</p><p>Investigators immediately exploited the rioters’ use of Facebook. On the day of the attack, the FBI requested that Facebook identify “any users that broadcasted live videos which may have been streamed and/or uploaded to Facebook from physically within the building of the United States Capitol during the time on January 6, 2021, in which the mob had stormed and occupied the Capitol building.” Complying with this request was possible because Facebook records the latitude and longitude of every uploaded photo and video by default.</p><p>Facebook responded the very same day, and again over the next few weeks, with an unknown number of user IDs—unique identifiers assigned to accounts on Facebook and Instagram (which Facebook’s parent company, Meta, also owns). The legal documents suggest that about 35 rioters were identified this way, without first being named by witnesses. In many cases, the FBI then requested that Facebook send it the relevant images and videos and other account data.</p><p>Investigators gleaned further clues from many hours of professional news footage, as well as 14,000 hours of high-resolution video from dozens of fixed security cameras and 2,000 hours of video from body-worn cameras operated by police responding to the riot. Surveillance cameras were referenced in 63 percent of DOJ cases, open-source videos and social-media images in 41 percent, and body-camera and news footage each in about 20 percent of cases.</p><p>Processing these files involved a huge amount of human effort. The body-camera footage alone required a team of 60, who laboriously completed a 752-page spreadsheet detailing relevant clips.</p><p>Shortly after the 6 January riot, <em>Spectrum</em> reported on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/facial-recognition-and-the-us-capitol-insurrection" target="_self">how automated image</a><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/facial-recognition-and-the-us-capitol-insurrection" target="_self">-</a><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/facial-recognition-and-the-us-capitol-insurrection" target="_self">recognition systems could be brought to bear</a> on this flood of audiovisual information. The FBI assigned its FACE Services Unit to compare suspects’ faces with images in state and federal face-recognition systems. However, according to the legal documents, only 25 rioters appear to have been first identified through such automated image searches, mostly after comparisons with state driver’s license photos and passport applications.</p><p>Hoan Ton-That, CEO of <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/" target="_blank">Clearview AI</a>, a face-recognition search engine that indexes 30 billion images from the open Internet, told <em>Spectrum</em> that the court filings do not necessarily reflect how often such technology was used. “Law enforcement don’t always have to disclose that they found a certain person’s information through facial recognition,” he says.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt="Photo of crowds of people standing in front of the U.S. Capitol Building. Some are holding flags. " class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="294c699725e3b3072b287f788cc259ac" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="a2a9b" loading="lazy" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-crowds-of-people-standing-in-front-of-the-u-s-capitol-building-some-are-holding-flags.png?id=32627143&width=980"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Ton-That notes that Clearview’s algorithm is not yet admissible in court, and that any identification it makes from open-source imagery requires further vetting and confirmation. Without providing specifics, he suggested that Clearview’s system was used by the FBI. “As a company, it was gratifying for us to play a small role in helping apprehend people who caused damage and stormed the Capitol,” he told <em>Spectrum</em>. The Capitol riot wouldn’t have been the first time that such technology was applied in this way. Facial recognition was reportedly used to identify protestors at a Black Lives Matter event in New York City in 2020 and at similar protests across the United States.</p><p>Computers are generally much better at recognizing letters and numbers than faces; automatic license plate reader (ALPR) technology was cited in 20 of the DOJ cases. There are likely tens of thousands of fixed and mobile ALPR systems in the United States alone, at toll plazas, bridge crossings, and elsewhere, capturing hundreds of millions of car journeys each month.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>How digital data makes it easier to connect the dots</h2><p>A single stream of data may help a little, but the integration of many such streams can do wonders. Take the case of William Vogel. He was first named by a tipster who sent the FBI a Snapchat video filmed by someone, unpictured, inside the Capitol building. Sure enough, a Facebook account associated with the Snapchat account listed Vogel as its owner and included a cellphone number.</p><p>But maybe someone stole Vogel’s cellphone and his Snapchat login to shoot and upload the video. Vogel’s phone number led to an address in Pawling, N.Y., and to a car registered to Vogel. The FBI then logged on to ALPR systems across several states, revealing that Vogel’s vehicle had taken the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx into Manhattan at 6:06 a.m. on 6 January, entered New Jersey at 7:54, and proceeded southbound through Baltimore at 9:15. The car made its return journey late that afternoon, eventually crossing back into New York a minute before midnight.</p><p>But, again, perhaps someone had borrowed Vogel’s car? Not according to an ALPR photo snapped in rural Maryland at 8:44 a.m. It shows a distinctive large red “Make America Great Again” hat on the car’s dashboard, just like one that Vogel was wearing when he was filmed on a news broadcast outside the Capitol later that day, and in a Facebook selfie.</p><p>“They’re trying to report me to the FBI/DOJ and put me away for 10 years for domestic terrorism, because of my Snapchat story,” Vogel complained later via Facebook Messenger, after admitting to a friend that he had in fact shot the Capitol video, charging documents allege. Vogel’s case goes to trial in February 2023, when he will face charges of violently entering the Capitol and disorderly conduct.</p><p>Investigators also homed in on people by looking at data from their cellphones. At least 2,000 digital devices were searched by the FBI for images, data, and messages. The FBI’s Cellular Analysis Survey Team is dedicated to locating cellphones based on which cell towers they access. Although the FBI got rough locations for about one-fifth of the Capitol-riot defendants this way, it’s too imprecise to reliably indicate whether someone actually breached the Capitol itself or remained outside the building.</p><p>Far more accurate are the geolocation data gathered by Google Maps and other apps, on both Android and Apple devices. By bolstering cell-tower data with information from nearby Wi-Fi routers and Bluetooth beacons, these apps can locate a target to within about 10 meters (better in urban areas, worse in the countryside). They can even work on phones that have been put in airplane mode.</p><h3></h3><br/><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12095105?672664"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p> <span></span>Until the 6 January attacks, geofence search warrants served on Google—for example, by agents investigating a bank robbery—might produce just a dozen suspect devices. The Capitol breach resulted in 5,723, by far the largest such production. It took until early May 2021 for Google to hand over the data to the FBI; when it did so, the results were comprehensive. That data included the latitude and longitude of each device to seven decimal places, and how long it was inside the Capitol. After narrowing the results to only those most likely to have breached the Capitol, Google eventually delivered the names, phone numbers, and emails associated with the accounts—everything investigators needed to identify and track someone inside the Capitol that day.</p><p>
	And track they did. The legal documents indicate that the Google geofence warrants yielded more initial identifications—50 individuals—than did any other technology, and they were cited in a total of 128 cases. Investigators were able to match interior surveillance footage of one suspect, Raul Jarrin, with a photo he was taking on his Samsung cellphone at the exact same moment. They later acquired the photo from Google under a separate warrant. Jarrin was arrested in March 2022.
</p><p>
<span></span>On top of the Google data, the FBI served geofence search warrants for anonymized location data from 10 data-aggregation companies. But none of these companies were cited in a criminal complaint, and there are no further details.
</p><p>
	The EFF sees the tremendous scope and power of geofence warrants as 
	<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/geofence-warrants-and-reverse-keyword-warrants-are-so-invasive-even-big-tech-wants" target="_blank">a bug, not a feature</a>. “We believe that geofence warrants are unconstitutional because they don’t start with a suspect,” says Lynch. “They don’t rely on individualized suspicion, which is what’s required under the Fourth Amendment [to the U.S. Constitution]. In the January 6th context, it’s likely that there were many journalists whose data was provided to the police.”
</p><p>
	Lynch points out that geofence warrants were also used to investigate possible arsons that occurred during protests over police brutality in Seattle, in 2020. Even though the fires were set at a known location at a known time, the warrants sought location data for all devices on an entire city block over a 75-minute period, during a Black Lives Matter protest. “I think that we would all agree that [the protest] was constitutionally protected First Amendment activity,” she says. “That information should never be in the hands of law enforcement, because it chills people from feeling comfortable speaking out against the government.”
</p><p>
	Google told 
	<em>Spectrum</em> that it examines all geofence warrants closely for legal validity and constitutional concerns. It says it routinely pushes back on overbroad demands, and in some cases refuses to produce any information at all.
</p><h2>Geofences target places, not people—and that’s a problem</h2><p>
	Of course, the idea of staking out a particular area for scrutiny is old hat. “Look at every car parked on Elm Street,” says the detective, in just about any procedural, ever. What’s new is the ability to survey any area immediately, easily, and over a wide range of databases—every phone call placed, car parked, person employed, credit-card transaction made, and pizza sold.
</p><p>
	And indeed, the high-tech investigations around the Capitol breach went far beyond suspects’ phones to include Uber rides, users’ search history, Apple iCloud, and Amazon. The FBI noted that one suspect, Hatchet Speed, a U.S. Navy reserve officer assigned to the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office, had purchased a black face mask and black “Samurai Tactical Wakizashi Tactical” backpack on Amazon, both of which he was seen wearing in Capitol CCTV footage on 6 January. Speed was arrested in June 2022.

</p><p>
	Unsurprisingly, after the deadly riot, some of those present deleted their social-media posts, pictures, and accounts. One suspect threw his phone into the Atlantic Ocean. Annie Howell of Swoyersville, Pa., allegedly posted videos of her clashes inside the Capitol with law enforcement. According to her charging document, on 26 January 2021, Howell conducted a factory reset of her Apple iPhone, without backing up data from her online iCloud account. In a Facebook conversation with her father from her computer, he told her, “Stay off the clouds! They are how they are screwing with us.”
</p><p>
	The legal documents allege that around 150 others also attempted to delete data and accounts. For many, it was far too late. “The FBI’s really good at finding information that’s deleted, because, as you might know, if you delete a text or an app on a cellphone, it’s not really deleted,” an FBI agent told a January 6 suspect during an interrogation, as reported in one court filing. Investigators were indeed able to recover chats, social-media posts, call records, photos, videos, and location data from many devices and accounts that suspects thought they had permanently consigned to the digital trash can. The FBI even used such efforts to identify suspects: It asked Google to single out those devices in the geofence warrant whose users had attempted to delete their location history in the days following the siege. That process netted an additional 37 people. In March 2022, Howell was sentenced to 60 days in jail.
</p><h2>Raising a hue and cry—digitally</h2><p>
	Perhaps the biggest innovation in the 6 January investigations was nothing that law enforcement itself did, but rather the general public’s response. Using tools and processes pioneered by open-source investigation organizations like 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/qa-the-founder-of-bellingcat-on-how-social-media-enables-new-forms-of-investigation" target="_self">Bellingcat</a>, websites such as <a href="https://jan6attack.com/" target="_blank">Jan6attack.com</a> and <a href="https://seditionhunters.org/" target="_blank">Sedition Hunters</a> provided a forum for ordinary people in the United States and around the world to analyze and speculate (sometimes correctly, sometimes wrongly) on the identity of rioters. The FBI cited such efforts in 63 legal documents.
</p><p>
	Nonprofit investigative newsroom ProPublica became involved when a source provided 30 terabytes of video—over a million video clips—that had been scraped from the social-media network Parler. “One thing that was really helpful was that Parler wasn’t built very well,” says Al Shaw, deputy editor on ProPublica’s News Application Team. “There was all this metadata still attached to the files when they were leaked. We had geo information, what cellphone they were using, time stamps, and a bunch of other data.”
</p><p>
	ProPublica filtered the videos by geolocation and other metadata, but soon realized that not all the data was accurate. So journalists went through videos manually to check that those that appeared to have been shot inside the Capitol actually were. ProPublica ended up with 2,500 videos that it could definitively place in the Senate complex on 6 January.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12219969?672664">
<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"> </script>
</div></div><p>
	It quickly 
	<a href="https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/" target="_blank">published 500 of these videos</a> online. Scrolling through the videos is like fast-forwarding through that chaotic day all over again. “One of the design ideas was, can we build a ‘sad TikTok’?” says Shaw. “It’s got a similar interface to TikTok or Instagram, where you’re seeing what’s going on generally in chronological order.” ProPublica’s videos were cited by the DOJ in at least 24 cases.
</p><p>
	The remaining 2,000 Parler videos shot from 6 January are now languishing on ProPublica’s servers and could almost certainly help identify more rioters. And the hundreds of thousands of videos discarded in the filtering process could very well contain evidence of further crimes and misdemeanors, as could the thousands of unsearched smartphones and unscraped social-media accounts of other people who went to Washington that day.
</p><p>
	But at some point, says EFF’s Lynch, we should ask what we’re really fighting for. “We could, of course, solve more crime if we let police into everybody’s house,” she says. “But that’s not the way our country is set up, and if we want to maintain a democracy, there have to be limits on surveillance technologies. The technology has advanced faster than the law can keep up.”
</p><p>
	In practice, that means that some federal courts have found geofence warrants unconstitutional, while others continue to permit their use. Similarly, some jurisdictions are limiting the retention of ALPR data by law-enforcement agencies and the use of facial-recognition technologies by police. Meanwhile, though, private companies are mining ever more open-source images and location information for profit.
</p><p>
	In the eternal struggle between security and privacy, the best that digital-rights activists can hope for is to watch the investigators as closely as they are watching us.

That is, about grasping a single item from a bin of items, and then dropping that item into a different bin, where it may go toward building a customer order. Picking a single item from a jumble of items can be tricky for robots (especially when the number of different items may be in the millions). While the problem’s certainly not solved, in a well-structured and optimized environment, robots are nevertheless still getting pretty good at this kind of thing.<br/></p><p>Amazon has been on a path toward the kind of robots that can pick items since at least 2015, when the company sponsored the <a href="http://pwurman.org/amazonpickingchallenge/2015/index.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Picking Challenge at ICRA</a>. And just a month ago, Amazon introduced Sparrow, which it describes as “<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/new/transportation/amazon-robot-sparrow-streamlines-order-fulfillment-process" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the first robotic system in our warehouses that can detect, select, and handle individual products in our inventory</a>.” What’s important to understand about Sparrow, however, is that like most practical and effective industrial robots, the system surrounding it is doing a lot of heavy lifting—Sparrow is being presented with very robot-friendly bins that makes its job far easier than it would be otherwise. This is not unique to Amazon, and in highly automated warehouses with robotic picking systems it’s typical to see bins that either include only identical items or have just a few different items to help the picking robot be successful.</p><p class="pull-quote">Doing the picking task in reverse is called stowing, and it’s the way that items get into Amazon’s warehouse workflow in the first place. </p><p>But robot-friendly bins are simply not the reality for the vast majority of items in an Amazon warehouse, and a big part of the reason for this is (as per usual) humans making an absolute mess of things, in this case when they stow products into bins in the first place. <a href="https://goodrobot.ai/" target="_blank">Sidd Srinivasa</a>, the director of Amazon Robotics AI, described the problem of stowing items as “a nightmare.... Stow fundamentally breaks all existing industrial robotic thinking.” But over the past few years, <a href="https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/how-amazon-robotics-researchers-are-solving-a-beautiful-problem" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Robotics researchers have put some serious work into solving it</a>.</p><hr/><p>First, it’s important to understand the difference between the robot-friendly workflows that we typically see with bin-picking robots, and the way that most Amazon warehouses are actually run. That is, with humans doing most of the complex manipulation.</p><p>You may already be familiar with <a href="https://robots.ieee.org/robots/kiva/" target="_blank">Amazon’s drive units</a>—the mobile robots with shelves on top (called pods) that autonomously drive themselves past humans who pick items off of the shelves to build up orders for customers. This is (obviously) the picking task, but doing the same task in reverse is called stowing, and it’s the way that items get into Amazon’s warehouse workflow in the first place. It turns out that humans who stow things on Amazon’s mobile shelves do so in what is essentially a random way in order to maximize space most efficiently. This sounds counterintuitive, but it actually makes a lot of sense.</p><p>When an Amazon warehouse gets a new shipment of stuff, let’s say Extremely Very Awesome Nuggets (EVANs), the obvious thing to do might be to call up a pod with enough empty shelves to stow all of the EVANs in at once. That way, when someone places an order for an EVAN, the pod full of EVANs shows up, and a human can pick an EVAN off one of the shelves. The problem with this method, however, is that if the pod full of EVANs gets stuck or breaks or is otherwise inaccessible, then nobody can get their EVANs, slowing the entire system down (demand for EVANs being very, very high). Amazon’s strategy is to instead distribute EVANs across multiple pods, so that some EVANs are always available. </p><p>The process for this distributed stow is random in the sense that a human stower might get a couple of EVANs to put into whatever pod shows up next. Each pod has an array shelves, some of which are empty. It’s up to the human to decide where the EVANs best fit, and Amazon doesn’t really care as long as human tells the inventory system where the EVANs ended up. Here’s what this process looks like:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p><p>Two things are immediately obvious from this video: First, the way that Amazon products are stowed at automated warehouses like this one is entirely incompatible with most current bin-picking robots. Second, it’s easy to see why this kind of stowing is “a nightmare” for robots. As if the need to carefully manipulate a jumble of objects to make room in a bin wasn’t a hard enough problem, you also have to deal with those elastic bands that get in the way of both manipulation and visualization, <em>and </em>you have to be able to grasp and manipulate the item that you’re trying to stow. Oof. </p><p>“For me, it’s hard, but it’s not too hard—it’s on the cutting edge of what’s feasible for robots,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-parness-5a9aaa46/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aaron Parness, senior manager of applied science at Amazon Robotics & AI</a>. “It’s crazy fun to work on.” Parness came to Amazon from Stanford and JPL, where he worked on robots like StickyBot and LEMUR and was responsible for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/heres-how-nasa-will-grab-an-asteroid" target="_self">this bonkers microspine gripper designed to grasp asteroids in microgravity</a>. “Having robots that can interact in high-clutter and high-contact environments is superexciting because I think it unlocks a wave of applications,” continues Parness. “This is exactly why I came to Amazon; to work on that kind of a problem and try to scale it.”</p><p>What makes stowing at Amazon both cutting edge and nightmarish for robots is that it’s a task that has been highly optimized for humans. Amazon has invested heavily in human optimization, and (at least for now) the company is very reliant on humans. This means that any robotic solution that would have a significant impact on the human-centered workflow is probably not going to get very far. So Parness, along with Senior Applied Scientist Parker Owan, had to develop hardware and software that could solve the problem as is. Here’s what they came up with:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><script src="https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/5k8cMyF9-5Zdv3OJ1.js"></script></div><p>On the hardware side, there’s a hook system that lifts the elastic bands out of the way to provide access to each bin. But that’s the easy part; the hard part is embodied in the end-of-arm tool (EOAT), which consists of two long paddles that can gently squeeze an item to pick it up, with conveyor belts on their inner surfaces to shoot the item into the bin. An extendable thin metal spatula of sorts can go into the bin before the paddles and shift items around to make room when necessary.<br/></p><p>To use all of this hardware requires some very complex software, since the system needs to be able to perceive the items in the bin (which may be occluding each other and also behind the elastic bands), estimate the characteristics of each item, consider ways in which those items could be safely shoved around to maximize available bin space based on the object to be stowed, and then execute the right motions to make all of that happen. By identifying and then chaining together a series of motion primitives, the Amazon researchers have been able to achieve stowing success rates (in the lab) of better than 90 percent.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><script src="https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/MxGdtONH-5Zdv3OJ1.js"></script></div><p>After years of work, the system is functioning well enough that prototypes are stowing actual inventory items at an Amazon fulfillment center in Washington state. The goal is to be able to stow 85 percent of the products that Amazon stocks (millions of items), but since the system can be installed within the same workflow that humans use, there’s no need to hit 100 percent. If the system can’t handle it, it just passes it along to a human worker. This means that the system doesn’t even need to reach 85 percent before it can be useful, since if it can do even a small percentage of items, it can offload some of that basic stuff from humans. And if you’re a human who has to do a lot of basic stuff over and over, that seems like it might be nice. Thanks, robots!</p><p>But of course there’s a lot more going on here on the robotics side, and we spoke with Aaron Parness to learn more.</p><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em>: </strong><strong>Stowing in an Amazon warehouse is a highly human-optimized task.

I don’t really think that’s a driver for us. The hard problem we’re trying to solve involves contact and also the reasoning. And that doesn’t change too much with the environment, I don’t think. Most of my team is not focused on questions of that nature, questions like, “If we could only make the bins this height,” or, “If we could only change this or that other small thing.” I don’t mean to say that Amazon won’t ever change processes or alter systems. Obviously, we are doing that all the time. It’s easier to do that in new buildings than in old buildings, but Amazon is still totally doing that. We just try to think about our product fitting into those existing environments. </p><p>I think there’s a general statement that you can make that when you take robots from the lab and put them into the real world, you’re always constrained by the environment that you put them into. With the stowing problem, that’s definitely true. These fabric pods are horizontal surfaces, so orientation with respect to gravity can be a factor. The elastic bands that block our view are a challenge. The stiffness of the environment also matters, because we’re doing this force-in-the-loop control, and the incredible diversity of items that Amazon sells means that some of the items are compressible. So those factors are part of our environment as well. So in our case, dealing with this unstructured contact, this unexpected contact, that’s the hardest part of the problem. </p><p class="pull-quote">“Handling contact is a new thing for industrial robots, especially unexpected, unpredictable contact. It’s both a hard problem, and a worthy one.”<br/>—Aaron Parness </p><p><strong>What information do you have about what’s in each bin, and how much does that help you to stow items?</strong></p><p><strong>Parness: </strong>We have the inventory of what’s in the bins, and a bunch of information about each of those items. We also know all the information about the items in our buffer [to be stowed]. And we have a 3D representation from our perception system. But there’s also a quality-control thing where the inventory system says there’s four items in the bin, but in reality, there’s only three items in the bin, because there’s been a defect somewhere. At Amazon, because we’re talking about millions of items per day, that’s a regular occurrence for us. </p><p>The configuration of the items in each bin is one of the really challenging things. If you had the same five items: a soccer ball, a teddy bear, a T-shirt, a pair of jeans, and an SD card and you put them in a bin 100 times, they’re going to look different in each of those 100 cases. You also get things that can look very similar. If you have a red pair of jeans or a red T-shirt and red sweatpants, your perception system can’t necessarily tell which one is which. And we do have to think about potentially damaging items—our algorithm decides which items should go to which bins and what confidence we have that we would be successful in making that stow, along with what risk there is that we would damage an item if we flip things up or squish things.</p><p class="pull-quote">“Contact and clutter are the two things that keep me up at night.”<br/>—Aaron Parness</p><p><strong>How do you make sure that you don’t damage anything when you may be operating with incomplete information about what’s in the bin?</strong></p><p><strong>Parness: </strong>There are two things to highlight there. One is the approach and how we make our decisions about what actions to take. And then the second is how to make sure you don’t damage items as you do those kinds of actions, like squishing as far as you can. </p><p>With the first thing, we use a decision tree. We use that item information to claim all the easy stuff—if the bin is empty, put the biggest thing you can in the bin. If there’s only one item in the bin, and you know that item is a book, you can make an assumption it’s incompressible, and you can manipulate it accordingly. As you work down that decision tree, you get to certain branches and leaves that are too complicated to have a set of heuristics, and that’s where we use machine learning to predict things like, if I sweep this point cloud, how much space am I likely to make in the bin?</p><p>And this is where the contact-based manipulation comes in because the other thing is, in a warehouse, you need to have speed. You can’t stow one item per hour and be efficient. This is where putting force and torque in the control loop makes a difference—we need to have a high rate, a couple of hundred hertz loop that’s closing around that sensor and a bunch of special sauce in our admittance controller and our motion-planning stack to make sure we can do those motions without damaging items.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">An overhead view of Amazon’s new stowing robot</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Amazon</small></p><p><strong>Since you’re operating in these human-optimized environments, how closely does your robotic approach mimic what a human would be doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Parness: </strong>We started by doing it ourselves. We also did it ourselves while holding a robotic end effector. And this matters a lot, because you don’t realize that you’re doing all these kinds of fine-control motions, and you have so many sensors on your hand, right? This is a thing. But when we did this task ourselves, when we observed experts doing it, this is where the idea of motion primitives kind of emerged, which made the problem a little more achievable.</p><p><strong>What made you use the motion primitives approach as opposed to a more generalized learning technique?</strong></p><p><strong>Parness: </strong>I’ll give you an honest answer—I was never tempted by reinforcement learning. But there were some in my team that were tempted by that, and we had a debate, since I really believe in iterative design philosophy and in the value of prototyping. We did a bunch of early-stage prototypes, trying to make a data-driven decision, and the end-to-end reinforcement learning seemed intractable. But the motion-primitive strategy actually turned me from a bit of a skeptic about whether robots could even do this job, and made me think, “Oh, yeah, this is the thing. We got to go for this.” That was a turning point, getting those motion primitives and recognizing that that was a way to structure the problem to make it solvable, because they get you most of the way there—you can handle everything but the long tail. And with the tail, maybe sometimes a human is looking in, and saying, “Well, if I play Tetris and I do this incredibly complicated and slow thing I can make the perfect unicorn shaped hole to put this unicorn shaped object into.” The robot won’t do that, and doesn’t need to do that. It can handle the bulk.</p><p><strong>You really didn’t think that the problem was solvable at all, originally?</strong></p><p><strong>Parness: </strong>Yes. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9mcPKe0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Parker Owan</a>, who’s one of the lead scientists on my team, went off into the corner of the lab and started to set up some experiments. And I would look over there while working on other stuff, and be like, “Oh, that young guy, how brave. This problem will show him.” And then I started to get interested. Ultimately, there were two things, like I said: it was discovering that you could use these motion primitives to accomplish the bulk of the in-bin manipulation, because really that’s the hardest part of the problem. The second thing was on the gripper, on the end-of-arm tool. </p><p class="pull-quote">“If the robot is doing well, I’m like, ‘This is achievable!’ And when we have some new problems, and then all of a sudden I’m like, ‘This is the hardest thing in the world!’ ” <br/>—Aaron Parness</p><p><strong>The end effector looks pretty specialized—how did you develop that? </strong></p><p><strong>Parness: </strong>Looking around the industry, there’s a lot of suction cups, a lot of pinch grasps. And when you have those kinds of grippers, all of a sudden you’re trying to use the item you’re gripping to manipulate the other items that are in the bin, right? When we decided to go with the paddle approach and encapsulate the item, it both gave us six degrees of freedom control over the item, so to make sure it wasn’t going into spaces we didn’t want it to, while also giving us a known engineering surface on the gripper. Maybe I can only predict in a general way the stiffness or the contact properties or the items that are in the bin, but I know I’m touching it with the back of my paddle, which is aluminum. </p><p>But then we realized that the end effector actually takes up a lot of space in the bin, and the whole point is that we’re trying to fill these bins up so that we can have a lot of stuff for sale on Amazon.com. So we say, okay, well, we’re going to stay outside the bin, but we’ll have this spatula that will be our in-bin manipulator. It’s a super simple tool that you can use for pushing on stuff, flipping stuff, squashing stuff.... You’re definitely not doing 27-degree-of-freedom human-hand stuff, but because we have these motion primitives, the hardware complemented that.</p><p>However, the paddles presented a new problem, because when using them we basically had to drop the item and then try to push it in at the same time. It was this kind of dynamic—let go and shove—which wasn’t great. That’s what led to putting the conveyor belts onto the paddles, which took us to the moon in terms of being successful. I’m the biggest believer there is now! Parker Owan has to kind of slow me down sometimes because I’m so excited about it.</p><p><strong>It must have been tempting to keep iterating on the end effector.</strong></p><p><strong>Parness: </strong>Yeah, it is tempting, especially when you have scientists and engineers on your team. They want everything. It’s always like, “I can make it better. I can make it better. I can make it better.” I have that in me too, for sure. There’s another phrase I really love which is just, “so simple, it might work.” Are we inventing and complexifying, or are we making an elegant solution? Are we making this easier? Because the other thing that’s different about the lab and an actual fulfillment center is that we’ve got to work with our operators. We need it to be serviceable. We need it to be accessible and easy to use. You can’t have four Ph.D.s around each of the robots constantly kind of tinkering and optimizing it. We really try to balance that, but is there a temptation? Yeah. I want to put every sensor known to man on the robot! That’s a temptation, but I know better.</p><p><strong>To what extent is picking just stowing in reverse? Could you run your system backwards and have picking solved as well?</strong></p><p><strong>Parness: </strong>That’s a good question, because obviously I think about that too, but picking is a little harder. With stowing, it’s more about how you make space in a bin, and then how you fit an item into space. For picking, you need to identify the item—when that bin shows up, the machine learning, the computer vision, that system has to be able to find the right item in clutter. But once we can handle contact and we can handle clutter, pick is for sure an application that opens up.</p><p>When I think really long term, if Amazon were to deploy a bunch of these stowing robots, all of a sudden you can start to track items, and you can remember that this robot stowed this item in this place in this bin. You can start to build up container maps. Right now, though, the system doesn’t remember.</p><p>Regarding picking in particular, a nice thing Amazon has done in the last couple of years is start to engage with the academic community more. My team sponsors research at MIT and at the University of Washington. And the team at University of Washington is actually looking at picking. Stow and pick are both really hard and really appealing problems, and in time, I hope I get to solve both!</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 14:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/amazon-warehouse-robots-2659064182</guid><category>Amazon</category><category>Warehouse robots</category><category>Warehouse automation</category><category>Robotics</category><dc:creator>Evan Ackerman</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-picture-of-a-clamp-like-manipulator-with-conveyor-belt-surfaces-at-the-end-of-a-robotic-arm-in-an-amazon-warehouse.jpg?id=32625001&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Disruption, Disrupted</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/disruptive-technology</link><description><![CDATA[

That counterintuitive finding is not from a grumpy pundit fed up with <a data-linked-post="2659040098" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ces-2023" target="_blank">CES</a> press conferences that seem little different from last year. Instead, it comes from management researchers studying the process of innovation who<strong> </strong>analyzed several decades’ worth of papers and patents. And it raises questions about how the innovation process may be changing.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Nature</em></a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> study</a> divides innovation into two categories: disruptive concepts that make old technologies obsolete, and concepts that consolidate knowledge based on existing technologies. A disruptive concept like the <a data-linked-post="2658669320" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/transistor-history" target="_blank">invention of the transistor</a> is needed to launch a new field, but consolidation is needed to put that new knowledge to practical purposes, such as using transistors to build a control system. “Any field needs a healthy balance of the two, but they have different roles in innovation,” says lead author <a href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/faculty/michael-park" target="_blank">Michael Park</a>, of the University of Minnesota.</p><p>“Economists have been studying economic growth and seeing it [can] slow down and stagnate in certain countries,” says <a href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/faculty/russell-funk" target="_blank">Russell Funk</a>, of Minnesota’s management school, and senior author of the <em>Nature</em> paper. Earlier studies lacked a standard metric to study a broad range of fields, so a few years ago he developed the C-D (consolidating-disruptive) index. He <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2366" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demonstrated it</a> by classifying the disruptive and consolidating elements of references in U.S. patents.</p><p>Many studies had credited disruptive ideas with causing the explosive growth of science and technology since the mid-20th century. However, Funk’s study found that the fraction of disruptive ideas in patents declined over time. That might explain observations that in recent years the pace of innovation has slowed, particularly in fields such as drug discovery, which has stalled in some areas.</p><p>To get a high-level view of disruptive innovation across a broader range, Funk, Park, and <a href="https://sociology.arizona.edu/people/erin-leahey" target="_blank">Erin Leahey</a> of the University of Arizona launched a computer analysis of some 25 million research papers published from 1945 to 2010 and 3.9 million U.S. patents from between 1976 and 2010. They searched for disruption and consolidation present in references in the papers and patents at the time of publication and for the five years that followed. They covered four fields in research papers: life sciences and biomedicine, physical sciences, social sciences, and technology. And they covered five patent categories: chemical, computers and communications, drugs and medical, electrical and electronic, and mechanical categories.</p><p>Their conclusion: The fraction of disruptive references and other input dropped steadily over the the period studied for all groups studied. </p><p>“There seems to be something in common across these fields,” says Funk. Exactly what is happening remains unclear. He hopes his work will stimulate others to look more systematically at common factors that may be behind the decline.</p><p>One important insight is that because the number of research papers overall has skyrocketed since 1945 while the number of disruptive papers has stayed roughly constant, the fraction of all papers that are disruptive has declined. “We are not saying [the difference reflects] the quality of the work,” says Park. The difference is that the more recent papers describe consolidating rather than disruptive inventions.</p><p>Funk says the broad range of fields with disruption decreasing across the board makes it unlikely that a few fields have passed their heyday after harvesting all the “low hanging fruit” of novelty, leaving little more to discover. However, he does think the rapid growth of research publishing may be producing another factor that limits disruption—a volume of publications so huge that researchers cannot keep up with the literature in their own fields, leaving them to miss the chance to discover disrupting ideas.</p><p>When asked if starting his study at the start of the post-WWII science and technology boom—which produced discoveries from transistors to the double helix—might have produced the decline seen now, Funk says it’s possible. But he also points to a related factor: Today’s scientific establishments have grown gigantic and, as the title of a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-0941-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2019 <em>Nature</em> paper</a> says, “Large teams develop and small teams disrupt science and technology.” </p><p>Thinking how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_K._Kao" target="_blank">Charles Kao</a> disrupted the communications world by introducing fiber optics and the giant Bell Labs had to catch up, I see his point.</p><p><em>Updated 6 January 2023</em></p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2023 15:54:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/disruptive-technology</guid><category>Innovation</category><category>Research and development</category><category>Research management</category><category>Patents</category><dc:creator>Jeff Hecht</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-glowing-lightbulb-tips-off-the-end-of-a-stepped-block.jpg?id=32628749&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>IEEE Forms Board Dedicated to Its Humanitarian Activities</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-board-dedicated-humanitarian-activities</link><description><![CDATA[

	The 
	<a href="https://hac.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Humanitarian Activities Committee</a> has been elevated to the IEEE Humanitarian Technology Board, effective 1 January. The <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/board-board.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Board of Directors</a> approved the change in November.
</p><p>
	The new board will oversee all humanitarian activities across IEEE’s groups, regions, and societies and is responsible for fostering new collaborations. It also will fund related projects and activities.
</p><hr/><h3>About IEEE HAC</h3><br/><ul><li>HAC’s SIGHT program has about 34,000 members in 213 groups worldwide.</li><li>557 project proposals from 52 countries and seven IEEE regions were submitted to HAC and SIGHT last year.</li><li>It collaborated with more than 50 IEEE groups and programs last year.</li></ul><p>
	The change provides a systematic process for creating programs and managing existing ones.
</p><p>
	HTB is expected to focus on raising awareness of how technically trained people can contribute to society and provide training on how to go about doing that. The board also will continue HAC’s work building a sustainable development community within and beyond IEEE by partnering with the 
	<a href="https://www.un.org/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Nations</a> and other organizations.
</p><p>
	HTB also will continue to host HAC’s annual Global Summit. The virtual event connects IEEE members from around the world who are using or want to use their technical expertise to address sustainable development challenges.
</p><p class="pull-quote">
	“The new board is going to benefit all of IEEE’s humanitarian and sustainable development programs and enhance the member experience across the world.”
</p><p>
	“Bringing together IEEE groups to collaborate on humanitarian projects and working with outside organizations will help make IEEE a world leader in sustainable development,” says IEEE Senior Member 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/an-autism-screening-tool-led-sampathkumar-veeraraghavan-to-devote-himself-to-humanitarian-work" target="_self">Sampathkumar Veeraraghavan</a>, the 2021–2022 HAC chair. “By doing so, IEEE can have a more graduated and aggregated global impact.”
</p><p>
	“HTB allows IEEE to more effectively coordinate programs and projects across the organization,” adds 
	<a href="http://marcbeebe.com/about-me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marc Beebe</a>, senior director of IEEE strategic research, public imperatives, and corporate development. Beebe helped write the proposal to elevate HAC to a board. “Showing members the work IEEE is doing in the humanitarian sector creates a level of engagement that is just really important for members and for IEEE as an organization.”
</p><h2>Recognition of record growth and impact</h2><p>
	HAC has grown significantly in membership and collaborations with IEEE groups and other organizations during the past two years. The number of humanitarian projects funded last year increased by almost 50 percent over 2020.
</p><p>
	For its efforts, HAC was honored with the 
	<a href="https://www.asaecenter.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Society of Association Executives</a>’ <a href="https://www.asaecenter.org/about-us/news_releases/2022/asae-announces-2022-power-of-associations-award-recipients" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Power of Associations Summit Award</a> in the global development category. It was the first time IEEE received the award for its humanitarian activities.
</p><p>
	“Receiving this honor is very special because it’s a historic milestone for the committee,” Veeraraghavan says. “I’m very excited that it won this award and am proud of how much HAC has grown over the past two years, despite the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
</p><p>
	“Given IEEE HAC’s growth and global recognition, I think HTB is a great evolution for the committee,” he says. “It’s also going to benefit all of IEEE’s humanitarian and sustainable development programs and enhance the member experience across the world.”

</p><h2>IEEE’s humanitarian programs</h2><p>
	HTB will be collaborating—and coordinating humanitarian efforts—with existing activities and programs including the following.
</p><p>
<a href="https://epics.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>EPICS in IEEE (Engineering Projects in Community Service)</strong></a> empowers students to apply technical solutions to improve their communities and provides them with mentoring. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/students-win-10000-grant-to-build-3dprinted-prosthetics-for-dogs" target="_self">EPICS</a> also funds engineering projects in four core categories: access and abilities; community needs; environment; and education and outreach.
</p><p>
	The 
	<a href="https://move.ieeeusa.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>IEEE MOVE (Mobile Outreach VEhicle)</strong></a> program provides communities worldwide with power, phone service, and Internet access in areas of widespread outages caused by floods, wildfires, and other natural disasters. The <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieees-natural-disaster-relief-program-expanding-to-india-jamaica-and-puerto-rico" target="_self">MOVE truck</a> is equipped with satellite Internet access, IP phone service, and the ability to charge up to 100 cellphone batteries simultaneously. The vehicle has a generator as well as three solar panels that sit on the roof. It also has a mobile television—for tracking storms—and radios for communications.
</p><p>
	The 
	<a href="https://www.ee-scholarship.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>IEEE Power & Energy Society Scholarship Plus Initiative</strong></a> provides scholarships and work experience to undergraduates who are interested in an engineering career in power and energy. The <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-scholarship-program-helps-increase-the-number-of-newly-minted-power-engineers" target="_self">initiative</a> supports the students by providing up to three years of tuition assistance, facilitating internships and co-op experiences, and offering mentoring opportunities. Since its launch in 2011, more than 1,500 scholarships have been awarded to some 900 students from 200 colleges and universities in Canada and the United States. There are scholarship programs in India and Italy as well.
</p><p>
<a href="https://smartvillage.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>IEEE Smart Village</strong></a> brings electricity—as well as access to education and job opportunities—to more than 300,000 people in nearly three dozen remote, off-the-grid communities worldwide. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-14-microgrids-set-off-a-chain-reaction-in-a-himalayan-village" target="_self">Smart Village</a> members work with entrepreneurs in India, Nigeria, and other countries to help them set up micro-utilities, using solar panels and other renewable-energy technology to power homes, businesses, and schools.
</p><p>

I’ll be joining with an expected 100,000 or so other  retailers, journalists, and members of the consumer electronics industry.</p><p>After two years of almost pointless virtual shows, I’m excited to get my eyes and hands on real devices. It’s hard to tell a useful gadget from vaporware on a computer screen, and even harder to check out a new display technology when you’re looking at it on an old display technology!</p><p>I’m expecting to see AI in places both useful and silly, attempts to make a killer app for the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/metaverse-standards-forum" target="_blank">metaverse</a> (likely not <em>quite</em> killer just yet), and TVs with new features that manufacturers hope will get consumers to trade up from their existing sets. I’m booked to see some under-the-hood technologies that their developers hope will make it into consumer products soon. And I hope to find out more about the coming over-the-counter hearing aids, the use of radar technology in consumer products, and devices (beyond <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/man-stranded-in-alaska-rescued-after-using-iphones-emergency-sos-satellite" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new iPhones</a>) that will boast built-in satellite connections.</p><p>But, as always, the highlight of CES for me is the hidden treasure—a gadget I didn’t know I needed but is clever, well-designed, and solves a real-world problem. I’ll be hunting for those on the show floor, in booths big and small. And I will be looking for the gadgets on the other end of that spectrum of utility, as in, “This problem really isn’t looking for a tech solution.” (Visiting <a href="https://prelaunch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PreLaunch’s</a> new “Gallery of Flops” is definitely on my agenda.)</p><p>I’ve already started my hunt, via the press releases that have been inundating my email inbox for the past month or so. Hinting at a trend, many of these are health related, perhaps no surprise given that we’re coming out of a pandemic with a renewed focus on our health.</p><p>In no particular order, here are a few of the gadgets I’m planning to check out in person. At this point, little pricing information is available; I’ll add it as it emerges.</p><h2>Carbon nanotubes for touch-free presence sensing</h2><p><a href="https://somalytics.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Somalytics</a> claims that its paper-based, carbon-nanotube sensors, developed by <a href="https://www.washington.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Washington</a> researchers in collaboration with <a href="https://comotion.uw.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CoMotion</a>, can detect the presence of human tissue up to 20 centimeters away. At CES, Hyundai will be using the technology to demonstrate a gesture-controlled door handle. The technology will also appear in the SomaSleep mask, in which the sensors track eye movements.</p><h2>A stick-on-the-wall, wireless TV</h2><p>You have to love <a href="https://www.displace.tv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Displace’s</a> concept—a lightweight, fully wireless, 55-inch TV that sticks on the wall using built-in vacuum mounts. Who hasn’t wished they could install their flat screen without worrying about cables, mounts, or electrical outlets? The Displace TV is controlled via gesture, touch, or voice, and up to four screens can be snapped together to form a giant display. There is a separate hub that must be plugged in somewhere within the home. I’m just not quite sure if the plan to power the gadget via hot swappable rechargeable batteries is too much of a kludge, though the company says the TV averages a month of battery life when used for about 6 hours a day.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Virawarn</small></p><h2>A reusable breath test for COVID, RSV, and the flu</h2><p>We’ve been waiting for this one for a while—a breath test for COVID and other viruses. Opteev Technologies says its <a href="https://opteev.com/virawarn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ViraWarn</a> does it all. Those claims have yet to be verified, and the company indicates that clinical trials are ongoing. But I definitely want to check it out. The device uses cartridges that need to be changed only after a positive test or a couple of weeks of daily use and is designed to give results within 60 seconds.</p><h2>A phone dongle that takes the itch out of insect bites</h2><p><a href="https://just-heat-it.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heat It</a> has a simple (and, hopefully, inexpensive) gadget that plugs into a smartphone’s charging port when needed to zap away an itch or sting from an insect bite using heat. The company says it’s already sold 250,000 in Europe; CES is its U.S. launch. The idea is valid, as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257884/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heat has been shown to stop an itch</a>. The gadget is small enough to add to a keychain and will come in Android and iPhone versions.</p><h2>Fixing speech disorders in real time</h2><p>I have friends who struggle with essential tremors that can impact their ability to speak, so <a href="https://whispp.com/?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Whispp</a>’s speech technology got my attention. The company says its mobile app converts whispered speech, vocal-cord impaired speech, and severe stutters into a person’s natural voice in real time.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Epicore</small></p><h2>A sweat-monitoring wearable with a dehydration alarm</h2><p>I’ve <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/sweat-sensing-patch-aimed-athletes-takes-covid19" target="_self">been tracking</a> <a href="https://www.epicorebiosystems.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Epicore Biosystems</a> for some time. The company spun out of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-temporary-tattoo-that-senses-through-your-skin" target="_blank">John Rogers’s</a> research group at <a href="https://rogersgroup.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Northwestern University,</a> and has focused on flexible, wearable sensors. Most recently, they’ve been tracking sweat. The company’s first sweat-monitoring patch, the Gx, used microfluidics and color-changing chemicals, along with an app, to monitor hydration and was aimed at athletes. Now Epicore is introducing Connected Hydration, an electronic wearable that senses sweat and electrolyte loss, skin temperature, and motion, and gives dehydration alarms. The company says it is targeting this device at people working in harsh conditions, athletes grappling with extreme heat, and people living through severe heat waves. It claims a two-and-a-half-year battery life with no recharging.</p><h2>Checking vital signs with a selfie</h2><p>At least two companies will be demonstrating “useful selfies”—that is, technology that checks vital signs using a cellphone camera. <a href="https://nuralogix.ai/anura/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NuraLogix</a> claims its Anura app can take over 30 medical-grade vital-sign measurements via video analysis of facial blood flow. <a href="https://www.caducy.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I-Virtual</a> claims its video analysis device currently measures heart rate, breathing rate, stress level, and heart rate variability, and says that more capabilities will be added.</p><h2>Biometric IDs for cats and dogs</h2><p>At first glance, Petnow’s plan to establish a pet identification system using biometrics seemed a bit silly. But the under-the-skin invasiveness of the RFID pet identification system and the need to visit an animal clinic visit to get a chip inserted provokes resistance in some pet owners. <a href="https://petnow.io/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Petnow</a> aims to use nose prints for dogs and facial recognition for cats as identification methods, with scans done by pet owners using a mobile phone. It’s a long way from developing the tools that capture biometric data to creating a database of pets that’s widespread enough to be useful, but I wish the company luck.</p><h2>Using ambient light for power</h2><p>Power has been an ongoing issue with the Internet of Things. Although low-powered devices eke out long lives on batteries, batteries don’t last forever. <a href="https://dracula-technologies.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dracula Technologies</a> says its extremely thin, organic photovoltaic <a href="https://dracula-technologies.com/layer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Layer</a> device can generate electricity in extremely low light—a level comparable to that emitted by an emergency exit sign. And it can be produced in any shape, eliminating the design constraints created by batteries.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

The company will sell cartridges intended to monitor specific health conditions. The first two will cover general metabolism and menstrual tracking, and cartridges to track other medical conditions are on deck.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 18:00:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ces-2023</guid><category>Ces 2023</category><category>Gadgets</category><category>Wearables</category><category>Covid test</category><category>Sweat sensors</category><category>Carbon nanotubes</category><category>Ces</category><dc:creator>Tekla S.

	An electromagnetic actuator is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy in the form of linear or rotational motion. The motion can be used, for example, to vibrate a speaker diaphragm, open and close an<br/>
	electromagnetic valve, or open and close an electromagnetic relay.
</p><p>
	A typical electromagnetic actuator consists of various components including coils, magnets, magnetic material, andother mechanical and electronic components for control. Designing a complex actuator system involving these<br/>
	components can be challenging. Engineers and scientists can use finite element analysis (FEA) software to design and optimize these systems more efficiently.
</p><p>
	In this webinar, guest speaker Nirmal Paudel of Veryst Engineering will demonstrate a workflow for designing an electromagnetic actuator using the COMSOL Multiphysics® simulation software and its parametric sweep and<br/>
	optimization tools in both static and transient simulations.

And as chip fabs march toward the outer reaches of Moore’s Law, interconnects are also becoming the industry’s choke point.<br/></p><p>“For some 20-25 years now, copper has been the metal of choice for interconnects. However we’re reaching a point where the scaling of copper is slowing down,” IBM’s Chris Penny, told engineers last month at the <a href="https://www.ieee-iedm.org/" target="_blank">IEEE International Electron Device Meeting (IEDM)</a>. “And there is an opportunity for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cobalt-could-untangle-chips-wiring-problems" target="_blank">alternative conductors</a>.”</p><p><a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/44/ruthenium" target="_blank">Ruthenium</a> is a leading candidate, but it’s not as simple as swapping one metal for another, according to research reported at IEDM 2022. The processes of how they’re formed on a chip must be turned upside down. These new interconnects will need a different shape and a higher density. These new interconnects will also need better insulation, lest signal-sapping capacitance take away all their advantage.</p><p>Even where the interconnects go is set to change, and soon. But studies are starting to show, the gains from that shift come with a certain cost.</p><h2>Ruthenium, top vias, and air gaps</h2><p>Among the replacements for copper, ruthenium has gained a following. But research is showing that the old formulas used to build copper interconnects are a disadvantage to ruthenium. Copper interconnects are built using what’s called a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/damascene-process" target="_blank">damascene process</a>. First chip makers use lithography to carve the shape of the interconnect into the dielectric insulation above the transistors. Then they deposit a liner and a barrier material, which prevents copper atoms from drifting out into the rest of the chip to muck things up.  Copper then fills the trench. In fact, it overfills it, so the excess must be polished away.</p><p>All that extra stuff, the liner and barrier, take up space, as much as 40-50 percent of the interconnect volume, Penny told engineers at IEDM. So the conductive part of the interconnects are narrowing, especially in the ultrafine vertical connections between layers of interconnects, increasing resistance. But IBM and Samsung researchers have found a way to build tightly-spaced, low-resistance ruthenium interconnects that don’t need a liner or a seed. The process is called spacer assisted litho-etch litho-etch, or <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/1nm-chips-vtfet-ruthenium" target="_blank">SALELE</a>, and, as the name implies, it relies on a double helping of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet_lithography" target="_blank">extreme-ultraviolet lithography</a>. Instead of filling in trenches, it etches the ruthenium interconnects out of a layer or metal and then fills in the gaps with dielectric.</p><p>The researchers achieve the best resistance using tall, thin horizontal interconnects. However, that increases capacitance, trading away the benefit. Fortunately, due to the way SALELE builds <a href="https://www.wevolver.com/article/what-is-a-via-a-comprehensive-guide" target="_blank">vertical connections called vias</a>—on top of horizontal interconnects instead of beneath them—the spaces between slender ruthenium lines can easily be filled with air, which is the best insulator available. For these tall, narrow interconnects “the potential benefit of adding an air gap is huge… as much as a 30 percent line capacitance reduction,” said Penny.</p><p>The SALELE process “provides a roadmap to 1-nanometer processes and beyond,” he said.</p><h2>Buried rails, back-side power delivery, and hot 3D chips</h2><p>As early as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/whats-next-for-moores-law" target="_blank">2024, Intel plans</a> to make a radical change to the location of interconnects that carry power to transistors on a chip. The scheme, called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-gen-chips-will-be-powered-from-below" target="_blank">back-side power delivery</a>, takes the network of power delivery interconnects and moves it beneath the silicon, so they approach the transistors from below. This has two main advantages: It allows electricity to flow through wider, less resistive interconnects, leading to less power loss. And it frees up room above the transistors for signal-carrying interconnects, meaning logic cells can be smaller. (Researchers from Arm and the Belgian nanotech research hub <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en" target="_blank">Imec</a> explained it all <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-gen-chips-will-be-powered-from-below" target="_self">here</a>.)</p><p>At<a href="https://www.ieee-iedm.org/" target="_blank"> IEDM 2022</a>, Imec researchers came up with some formulas to make back-side power work better, by finding ways to move the end points of the power delivery network, called buried power rails, closer to transistors without messing up those transistors’ electronic properties. But they also uncovered a somewhat troubling problem, back-side power could lead to a build-up of heat when used in 3D stacked chips.</p><p>First the good news: When imec researchers explored how much horizontal distance you need between a buried power rail and a transistor, the answer was pretty much zero. It took some extra cycles of processing to ensure that the transistors were unaffected, but they showed that you can build the rail right beside the transistor channel region—though still tens of nanometers below it. And that could mean even smaller logic cells.</p><p>Now the bad news: In separate research, imec engineers simulated several versions of the same future CPU. Some had the kind of power delivery network in use today, called front-side power delivery, where all interconnects, both data and power, are built in layers above the silicon. Some had back-side power delivery networks . And one was a 3D stack of two CPUs, the bottom having back-side power and the top having front-side.</p><p>Back-side power’s advantages were confirmed by the simulations of the 2D CPUs. Compared to front-side delivery, it cut the loss from power delivery in half, for example. And transient voltage drops were less pronounced. What’s more, the CPU area was 8 percent smaller. However, the hottest part of back-side chip (relative to the boundary of the chip) was about 45 percent hotter than the hottest part of a front-side chip. The likely cause is that back-side power requires thinning the chip down to the point where it needs to be bonded to a separate piece of silicon just to remain stable. That bond acts as a barrier to the flow of heat.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-right" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: right;">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Researchers tested a scenario where a CPU [bottom grey] with a back-side power delivery network is bonded to a second CPU having a front-side power delivery network [top grey].</small></p><p>The real problems arose with the 3D IC. The top CPU has to get its power from the bottom CPU, but the long journey to the top had consequences. While the bottom CPU still had better voltage-drop characteristics than a front-side chip, the top CPU performed much worse in that respect. And the 3D IC’s power network ate up more than twice the power that a single front-side chip’s network would consume. Worse still, heat could not escape the 3D stack very well, with the hottest part of the bottom die almost 2.5 times as hot as a single front-side CPU. The top CPU was cooler, but not by much.</p><p>The 3D IC simulation is admittedly somewhat unrealistic,  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rongmei-chen-1a0b2752/?originalSubdomain=be" target="_blank">Rongmei Chen</a>, BSPDN project leader and senior research scientist at imec told engineers at IEDM. Stacking two otherwise identical CPUs atop each other is an unlikely scenario. (It’s much more common to stack memory with a CPU.) “It’s not a very fair comparison,” he said.

Startups show such futuristic pronouncements to potential investors, who in turn use them as data points to inform their bets. And as readers, we gravitate toward them, if only so we can feel superior when, say, a highly anticipated product launch bombs—chef’s kiss to Mark Zuckerberg for the schadenfreude fest that is <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/metaverse-meta-misfire" target="_self">the metaverse</a>. </p><hr/><p> Think of <em>IEEE</em> <em>Spectrum</em>’s annual technology forecast as prognostication filtered through a skeptical lens and years of ongoing coverage of technological advances from lab to market. Each January, we look at projects across the globe and from a range of engineering disciplines that will have major milestones in the coming year.  While some technologies flop and fade away, others produce multiple hype cycles that raise and then dash hopes again and again. Take flying cars. Back in 2007, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/loser-grounded" target="_self">we predicted</a> that the flying-car startup Terrafugia would fail. The company lurched along for years until finally ceasing U.S. operations in 2021, ironically just after receiving a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2021/01/29/this-flying-car-can-now-be-legally-flownbut-you-cant-drive-it-or-even-buy-it-yet/?sh=255295dc3b58" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Special Light-Sport Aircraft airworthiness certificate</a> from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. </p><p>But as we wrote in 2014, flying cars are <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-cars-the-bad-idea-that-will-not-die" target="_self">an idea that will not die</a>. And even though the road—or the flight path—to commercial success is riddled with regulatory and social obstacles, eVTOLs (a newer and less sullied, acronym-a-licious moniker for flying cars) have attracted <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-aircraft" target="_self">billions of dollars in investment</a> in recent years. And now, the sector seems poised to finally take off, as Editorial Director of Content Development Glenn Zorpette reports in his story about <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/opener-blackfly-evtol" target="_blank">Opener’s BlackFly eVTOL</a>.</p><p> Flying cars illustrate one path that emerging technologies follow, with innovators and investors taking chances and failing early on. True believers learn from those failures, ultimately leading to solutions that are then brought to market. </p><p>Sometimes, though, externalities like a changing climate fast-track technologies that have been languishing in development for decades. Back in 2001, Senior Editor Michael J. Riezenman wrote about <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/fuel-cells-for-the-long-haul-batteries-for-the-spurts" target="_self">hydrogen fuel cells</a> as a promising answer to long-haul transportation needs. Back then, the hydrogen economy seemed right around the corner. Fast-forward 22 years and Contributing Editor Peter Fairley reports on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/green-hydrogen" target="_blank">two Australian companies that aim to use hydrogen to make a big dent in the country’s greenhouse-gas emissions</a>. One company is using renewable energy to produce hydrogen as fuel for huge trucks to haul zinc ore. The other is developing <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/engineers-make-green-hydrogen-from-air" target="_self">a new generation of electrolyzers</a> to produce hydrogen for export, although exactly how that will work has yet to be determined. Thank the pressures of the climate crisis for this green-hydrogen boom. </p><p>Cryptocurrencies, which we’ve <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-worlds-first-bitcoin-conference" target="_self">been covering since they emerged</a>, have imploded over the last several months. This crypto winter has soured many people on that particular application of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-future-of-the-web-looks-a-lot-like-bitcoin" target="_self">blockchain technology</a>, but there are many other, perhaps more promising ways to apply a blockchain. One is as a means of providing proof of personhood, as the journalist Edd Gent <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/worldcoin" target="_blank">explores in his critical look at Worldcoin</a>. The company’s founders want Worldcoin to be not only a global currency that will somehow redistribute wealth via universal basic income but also a secure means of biometric identification, with a dose of buzzy, Web3 facilitation thrown in for good measure. And so, while crypto is tanking and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/non-fungible-tokens-gaming" target="_self">the NFT market has fizzled, </a>something useful may yet rise from the ashes of Web3. I’ll go out on a limb here and predict that Web3 will be recalled in years to come as a figment of some collective pandemic fever dream. </p><p>Check back in a few years to see how that prognostication pans out.

That seems to have been the reaction you (dear devoted <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> reader) took with your semiconductor article consumption. You dove deep with us into the inner workings of the very first transistor, but you also wanted to know what comes next. In between, taking some time to appreciate how fundamental forces are smashing up big system-on-chips, what an injection of government money could do to chip manufacturing in the United States, and some stranger stuff.</p><p>So to recap the semiconductor stories with the highest traffic numbers from this year, we’ve put together this set of highlights:</p><h3>The Transistor at 75</h3><br/><p>It’s hard to overstate—considering the utter ubiquity and profound significance of electronic technology in people’s lives today—the importance of the transistor, which was invented in December 1947. After all, we likely produced <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/transistor-density" target="_blank">2 billion trillion of them this year alone</a>. Yet there was only one in 1947, and it <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/transistor-history" target="_blank">worked pretty weirdly</a>. How we got from 1 to 2 billion trillion per year is a separate story. But what <em>Spectrum</em> readers were most interested in was how we’re going to make future billion trillions. The next step (well, the next, next step for some companies) seems pretty clear; it’s the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos" target="_blank">complementary FET</a>. That’s a PMOS and NMOS transistor built atop each other, likely all at once, potentially cutting the size of logic cells in half. What comes after that? At the 100th anniversary of the transistor there will likely be variations on that theme, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-transistor-of-2047-expert-predictions" target="_blank">our experts say</a>.</p><h3>The First High-Yield, Sub-Penny Plastic Processors</h3><br/><p>I’ve been listening to promises of cheap, flexible electronics my whole career. These could add intelligence to every currently-dumb  object on store shelves today. So where’s my smart-banana? This year, we finally got an answer: Until now, nobody has built working plastic processors that can be made in the billions for less than a penny each. Even the simplest industry-standard microcontrollers are too complex to make on plastic in bulk, because the yield of good “chips” (for want of a better word) is super low.  Engineers in Illinois and England came to the rescue with an architecture <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/plastic-microprocessor" target="_blank">simple enough to breach the one-penny barrier</a>.</p><h3>Single-Chip Processors Have Reached Their Limits</h3><br/><p>Coffins require a number of nails, but this year <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/single-chip-processors-have-reached-their-limits" target="_blank">two more were driven in</a> to the one bearing the concept of the PC or server CPU made from a single piece of silicon. Apple revealed that the M1 Ultra, now found inside Mac Studio, is a variant of the M1 that effectively fuses two chips into one using advanced packaging. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Nvidia</a> delivered similar news about its Grace CPU processors. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-circuits-break-bottleneck-in-microprocessors" target="_blank">Processor designers are giving up</a> on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-i860" target="_blank">the idea of one big chip</a> mostly because they’ve run out of silicon. Interconnecting two “<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3-ways-chiplets-are-remaking-processors" target="_blank">chiplets</a>” can give you a doubling of transistor count without needing to move to a more advanced chip making process.</p><h3>These 5 Charts Help Demystify the Global Chip Shortage</h3><br/><p>The chip shortage that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automotive-chip-shortage" target="_blank">squeezed automakers</a> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-shortage-rewiring-tech" target="_blank">and many others</a> so <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-shortage" target="_blank">hard in 2020 and 2021</a> was very much still with us in one form or another in 2022. Supply chains of all kinds were still showing their fragility, and semiconductors was no exception. It was even <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/maker-manufacturers-squeezed-chip-shortage" target="_blank">showing up in the maker space</a>. But a lot of the shortage talk was amplified by U.S. government officials, who were trying to get some major manufacturing legislation passed. (More on that below.) </p><h3>Intel's Take on the Next Wave of Moore's Law</h3><br/><p>In an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/whats-next-for-moores-law" target="_blank">interview in early December</a>, Ann B. Kelleher, general manager of technology development at Intel really tried to make me understand how a concept called system technology co-optimization (STCO) was going save Moore’s Law. It’s not that I wasn’t buying it; I was. (And <em>Spectrum</em> has been writing about STCO in one way or another <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/beat-the-heat" target="_blank">for nearly</a> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/eternal-bits" target="_blank">two decades</a>.) It’s just that it’s an idea that really needs an example to go with it. In STCO, you start with the software workload, figure out the functions needed for that, and then determine which functions should be implemented using which semiconductor manufacturing technology. All of those things feed back on each other, and so must be “co-optimized.” It’s possible to do that, because you can now break a system-on-chip into functional chiplets and stitch them together using 3D and other advanced packaging, so they act like a single large chip. As for the example, Kelleher recommends looking at the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-s-exascale-supercomputer-chip-is-a-master-class-in-3d-integration" target="_blank">Ponte Vecchio</a> accelerator behind the Aurora supercomputer. It’s made up of 47 pieces of silicon made using four different processes, three of which weren’t even Intel’s.</p><h3>3 Ways 3D Chip Tech is upending Computing</h3><br/><p>This was the year 3D chip packaging showed up in force, at least in the high-end logic arena. AI supercomputer startup Graphcore used some TSMC 3D chip-stacking tech to improve the flow of power to its chip in a way that could lead to a 40 percent speed up in training neural networks. AMD used a different TSMC tech to give it’s compute chiplets a major memory boost. And Intel through every chip packaging tech they had to Ponte Vecchio to build a 47-chiplet monster. As you’ve noticed if you’ve read any of the other items in this post, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-3d-stacking-intel-graphcore" target="_blank">this is the way of the future</a>.</p><h3>U.S. Passes Landmark Act to Fund Semiconductor Manufacturing</h3><br/><p>Legislation aimed at increasing semiconductor manufacturing in the United States <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chips-act-of-2022" target="_blank">finally became law</a> after a multiyear journey that saw many mutations and delays. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank">CHIPS and Science Act</a>, part of a larger $280 billion package, provides about US $52 billion for new or expanded facilities that make semiconductors or chipmaking equipment. And it arrived amidst efforts by other nations and regions to boost chip manufacturing, an industry increasingly seen as a key to economic and military security. Now, the hard part—figuring out who gets how much money.</p><h3>A Transistor for Sound Points Toward Whole New Electronics</h3><br/><p>Scientists have been chasing electronic devices based on topological materials, which basically protect the flow of current from disturbance because of the same math that tells you a donut and a coffee mug are fundamentally the same shape but cereal bowl and coffee mug are not. Harvard scientists took a detour they hope will lead to some breakthroughs, by building topological transistors that modulate sound instead of electrons. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topological-transistor-acoustic" target="_blank">The result</a> is a weird looking honeycomb system, that looks like it belongs in the inner workings of Iron Man’s suit. </p><h3>RISC-V AI Chips Will Be Everywhere</h3><br/><p>In 2022, the open source instruction set architecture RISC-V began what analysts see as a rapid penetration of the machine learning market. Early in the year, there was already silicon from startups aimed toward servers, like Esperanto AI, and those targeting “edge” computing like Kneron. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/risc-v-ai" target="_blank">Growth should continue to accelerate</a> now that there’s a standard set of vector instructions adopted by the organization governing RISC-V.</p><h3>Micron is First to Deliver 3D Flash Chips with More Than 200 Layers</h3><br/><p>While logic technology is still figuring out its path to 3D construction, Flash memory has been there for a while. Nevertheless, 2022 saw an important barrier passed, chips with more than 200 layers of memory cells. Boise, Idaho-based  <a href="https://www.micron.com/" target="_blank">Micron Technology</a> got their first with a 232-layer NAND flash-memory chip. It’s the first such chip to pass the 200-layer mark, and it’s been a tight race. <a href="https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-develops-worlds-highest-238-layer-4d-nand-flash/" target="_blank">SK Hynix says it is shipping samples of a 238-layer TLC product </a>that will be in full production in 2023. <span></span></p>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 16:24:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-chips-plastic-processors</guid><category>75th anniversary of the transistor</category><category>Stco</category><category>3d stacking</category><category>Intel</category><category>Micron</category><category>Risc-v</category><category>Topological materials</category><category>Chips act</category><category>Chip shortage</category><category>3d chips</category><dc:creator>Samuel K.

	Each January, the editors of 
	<em>IEEE Spectrum </em>offer up some predictions about technical developments we expect to be in the news over the coming year. You’ll find a couple dozen of those described in the following special report. Of course, the number of things we could have written about is far higher, so we had to be selective in picking which projects to feature. And we’re not ashamed to admit, gee-whiz appeal often shaped our choices.

	For example, this year’s survey includes an odd pair of new aircraft that will be taking to the skies. One, 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/airship" target="_blank">whose design was inspired by the giant airships of years past, is longer than a football field</a>; the other, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/opener-blackfly-evtol" target="_blank">a futuristic single-seat vertical-takeoff craft powered by electricity</a>, is about the length of a small car.
</p><p>
	While some of the other stories might not light up your imagination as much, they highlight important technical issues the world faces—like the 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/green-hydrogen" target="_blank">challenges of shifting from fossil fuels to a hydrogen-based energy economy</a> or the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/china-breeder-reactor" target="_blank">threat that new plutonium breeder reactors in China might accelerate the proliferation of nuclear weapons</a>. So whether you prefer reading about topics that are heavy or light (even lighter than air), you should find something here to get you warmed up for 2023.

I am renovating my kitchen, which was originally built in 1964. Although I’m happy to be rid of some of the disastrous 1960s design missteps—seriously, only one electrical receptacle in the entire kitchen?—I was sad to part with a small piece of history: my Amana Touchmatic Radarange microwave oven, with its 700 watts of glorious electromagnetic cooking power.</p><h2>The ever evolving and revolving microwave oven</h2><p>My Radarange was installed by the previous homeowner in 1980 and had a decidedly vintage feel, but it was actually a third-generation model. The original Radarange came out in 1947 and was intended for commercial kitchens. Two years prior, Raytheon engineer Percy Spencer had filed a patent for a “<a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/da/68/ea/2c1672112a6d9e/US2605383.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Means for Treating Foodstuff</a>,” and the company tested the oven in a Boston restaurant. This <a href="http://www.smecc.org/microwave_oven.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">water-cooled model </a>was the size of a modest refrigerator, standing approximately 1.7 meters tall and weighing 340 kilograms. It would take a while for the microwave oven to evolve into the countertop version we all know today. </p><p>Raytheon first entered the consumer market in 1955, but not with the Radarange. Instead, it <a href="https://richlandcountyhistory.com/2021/07/16/power-on-tappan-microwaves-1955/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">licensed the technology to Tappan</a>, a maker of conventional stoves that had pioneered the “see-through” glass oven door. Tappan produced the RL-1 microwave oven for home use with an initial retail price of $1,295 (about $14,400 today). With that price tag, it was obviously meant to impress.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Tappan produced only 34 microwaves in its first year, but it continued to have steady growth. It sold 1,396 units by the time production ceased in 1964.</p><p>Meanwhile, other companies were also testing the market. In April 1961, Sharp demonstrated a 2-kilowatt microwave prototype at the International Trade Fair in Tokyo. The following year the company released the R-10, a 1-KW model intended for restaurants and commercial use and priced at 540,000 yen (about $18,600 today). In 1966, Sharp introduced the R-600, the first microwave oven with a revolving turntable to help cook food more uniformly. The R-600 was compatible with standard household power sources and intended for home use, but at 200,000 yen ($5,600 today), it was still a luxury good. In the fall of 1967, Sharp debuted the R-1000, a commercial microwave with a new feature that’s still more or less with us: a bicycle bell that dinged when the cooking time ended.</p><p>To reenter the consumer market for microwave ovens, Raytheon in 1965 acquired Amana Corp., a manufacturer of home appliances based in Iowa. Two years later, Amana introduced the second generation of the Radarange, this one a compact model designed for the modern home kitchen. The price had fallen drastically, to $495 ($4,400 today)—still very expensive for the average household, but microwave ovens were gaining ground. In 1975 sales of microwave ovens in the United States outpaced those of conventional gas ovens for the first time. Consumers were sold on the convenience and <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/313914" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">futuristic power of quick cooking</a>. </p><h2>A case study in microwave cooking</h2><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The author’s Amana Touchmatic Radarange microwave oven dated from 1980. Its previous owner kept meticulous notes on how to use it. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Allison Marsh</small></p><p>The technology at the heart of the microwave oven is the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/magnetron" target="_self">cavity magnetron</a>, developed during World War II for radar detection. A <a href="https://www.smecc.org/percy_spenser_biography.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1958 article in <em>Reader’s Digest</em> </a>popularized the story of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-brief-history-of-the-microwave-oven" target="_self">Percy Spencer’s accidental discovery</a> that the cavity magnetron could heat food. But abundant documentation in the form of lab notebooks, patent filings, government reports, and office memos indicates that a series of observations led to the concept of the microwave oven, not a single eureka moment.</p><p>As the microwave oven transitioned from the laboratory to modern life, one aspect was not well documented: How did consumers learn to use this new appliance? The lack of such a paper trail is not so surprising. Did you save any notes on how to use your first smartphone? For these types of stories, historians often look for microhistories or individual case studies to draw broader conclusions about society. Lucky for me, Marion Steen, the gentleman who sold me his house, was extraordinarily organized and detail oriented. When I bought the house, he handed over a bundle of documentation for all of the appliances, including a three-ring binder containing handwritten notes on how to use the microwave.</p><p>Here’s what I learned: On 15 July 1980, Steen attended a class hosted by Susan Ambrose at the Display Center in West Columbia, S.C., to learn how to use his newly purchased Amana Radarange. He noted that microwaves cook by reflection, absorption, and transmission. Steen didn’t elaborate but according to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/resources-you-radiation-emitting-products/microwave-oven-radiation#:~:text=Cooking%20with%20Microwaves,-Microwaves%20are%20produced&text=The%20microwaves%20are%20reflected%20within,heat%20that%20cooks%20the%20food" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>, that’s exactly right. The magnetron produces microwaves, which are reflected within the metal interior of the oven. The food absorbs the microwaves, causing the water molecules to vibrate and produce heat, which in turn cooks the food. But microwaves penetrate only 1 to 2 centimeters into food, so only the outer layers of thicker pieces get directly cooked by microwaves; the interiors are cooked through the conduction of heat from the outside. The water content may vary across a dish, so a sauce may be boiling hot while a piece of meat may still be cold. Steen’s notes emphasize “Give some ‘standing time’ after cooking!!” This allows the heat to disperse more uniformly throughout the food.</p><p>Steen must have gone all in on the specialty cookware for his new microwave. Included in his binder are pamphlets for the Amana Radarange Popcorn Popper, the Amana Browning Skillet, the three-piece Amana Radarware Cook Kit (which included a browning grill, a 3-quart casserole made of Pyrex, and a roasting rack that doubled as a serving dish), and the Corning Ware Micromate browners. Steen didn’t leave behind any of these items, but the descriptions of the browners intrigued me. Made by Corning Glass Works for Amana, they had browning surfaces coated with tin oxide. The dishes had to be preheated empty in the Radarange. The coating would absorb the microwaves, causing the surface to become hot and turn yellow. Food pressed onto these surfaces would brown in 1 to 2 minutes, and then you’d flip it to brown the other side. Sure, you could achieve the same results in a skillet on your stove, but you have to admire the ingenuity at work here.</p><p>Included in all the cookware booklets are recipes. I love experimenting with recipes from old cookbooks, but some of these seem like a stretch. Would you really use your Amana Radarange Popcorn Popper to make popcorn, which you then grind up and add to meatloaf, which you then cook in your Amana Radarange? </p><p>Microwave manufacturers weren’t the only ones trying to educate consumers on how to use the new appliance. Packaged food manufacturers and plastic-wrap makers saw a new market for their products and created special recipe booklets. In my fabulous three-ring binder, I have “Microwave Cooking with Kellogg’s,” “Basic Instructions for Making Pillsbury Plus Cake Mixes in the Microwave Oven,” and “Saran Wrap & Microwave…The Perfect Pair!” Swanson, a longtime maker of frozen dinners, changed its packaging from aluminum trays to a “heat ’n serve” tray that could be used in either microwave or conventional ovens.</p><p>The <em>Introduction to Cooking with the Amana Radarange Cookbook</em> promises home chefs that they can make almost anything in a microwave. In his handwritten notes, Steen included directions on how to cook a roast (“15 minutes on full power, add vegetables, then 45 minutes on level 5”), scramble eggs (“always break yolks”), and bake a cake (“must use the special Bundt pan”—underlined twice for emphasis). What is missing is the outcome of these recipes. Call me a skeptic, but these are three things I have never made successfully in a microwave.</p><p>Steen, a native southerner, must have been heartbroken to write down, “Don’t cook biscuits in microwave.” My colleague Carol Harrison has a similar vivid memory of biscuit failure. Learning to cook with a microwave as a teenager, she tried to make simple refrigerator biscuits, but they didn’t brown. She kept adding time, but they still didn’t seem done. When she finally took them out, the outside remained a pale white, but the inside had turned to inedible charcoal. </p><p>As the Amana cookbook noted, breads don’t brown in a microwave oven. The book suggested using toppings such as rye or whole wheat flour to supply color, which seems a bit disingenuous. The lack of browning didn’t stop Amana from listing almost 20 pages of bread and muffin recipes.</p><p>An avid cook myself, I like to annotate my cookbooks with who in the family liked what recipes, minor alterations in ingredients, and changes to the directions. Sadly, Marion Steen left no such notes behind. I do not know what he cooked in his Radarange or how it tasted, and so I am left with only half the story. </p><p>In my new kitchen, I have opted for a microwave drawer. This technology, developed by Sharp and brought to market <a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/money/business/2020/03/04/sharp-microwave-drawers-memphis-celebrates-1-mill-build/4907880002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in 2005</a>, fits under the counter of the kitchen island. Although it has a lovely, sleek design, I chose it for practical reasons. The impetus for renovating came when my mother moved in with me last year. We are designing things to be as accessible as possible so that she can age in place. With a microwave drawer, she no longer has to lift plates above her head to reheat food, as she did with the over-the-stove Radarange. I only hope that Sharp can deliver 40-plus years of reliability like my Radarange did.</p><p><em>Part of a </em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/" target="_self"><em>continuing series</em></a> <em>looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></p><p><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the January 2023 print issue as “</em><em>The Microwave’s Slow Burn</em><em>.” </em></p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 20:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/microwave-oven</guid><category>Past forward</category><category>History of microwave ovens</category><category>Magnetron</category><category>Type:departments</category><dc:creator>Allison Marsh</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-rectangular-kitchen-appliance-with-a-metal-housing-a-glass-door-and-two-dials-on-the-righthand-side.jpg?id=32350797&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Video Friday: BRUCE</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-bruce</link><description><![CDATA[

It aims to launch a humdrum, lone geostationary satellite. But this satellite is the first of a new breed, dubbed microGEO. It’s about one-twentieth the size of the minibus-scale geostationary satellites already in orbit, allowing for cheap and quick deployment. This first microGEO will launch in <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/launch-schedule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">early 2023</a>, and start providing service to Alaska, tripling the state’s satellite bandwidth while cutting its cost.

<a name="big"></a><strong>The great advances in deep learning over the past decade or so have been powered by ever-bigger models crunching ever-bigger amounts of data. Some people argue that that’s an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-learning-computational-cost" target="_self">unsustainable trajectory</a>. Do you agree that it can’t go on that way?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Andrew Ng: </strong>This is a big question. We’ve seen foundation models in NLP [natural language processing]. I’m excited about NLP models getting even bigger, and also about the potential of building foundation models in computer vision. I think there’s lots of signal to still be exploited in video: We have not been able to build foundation models yet for video because of compute bandwidth and the cost of processing video, as opposed to tokenized text. So I think that this engine of scaling up deep learning algorithms, which has been running for something like 15 years now, still has steam in it. Having said that, it only applies to certain problems, and there’s a set of other problems that need small data solutions.
</p><p>
<strong>When you say you want a foundation model for computer vision, what do you mean by that?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> This is a term coined by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Percy Liang</a> and <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some of my friends at Stanford</a> to refer to very large models, trained on very large data sets, that can be tuned for specific applications. For example, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-ais-powerful-text-generating-tool-is-ready-for-business" target="_self">GPT-3</a> is an example of a foundation model [for NLP]. Foundation models offer a lot of promise as a new paradigm in developing machine learning applications, but also challenges in terms of making sure that they’re reasonably fair and free from bias, especially if many of us will be building on top of them.
</p><p>
<strong>What needs to happen for someone to build a foundation model for video?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> I think there is a scalability problem. The compute power needed to process the large volume of images for video is significant, and I think that’s why foundation models have arisen first in NLP. Many researchers are working on this, and I think we’re seeing early signs of such models being developed in computer vision. But I’m confident that if a semiconductor maker gave us 10 times more processor power, we could easily find 10 times more video to build such models for vision.
</p><p>
	Having said that, a lot of what’s happened over the past decade is that deep learning has happened in consumer-facing companies that have large user bases, sometimes billions of users, and therefore very large data sets. While that paradigm of machine learning has driven a lot of economic value in consumer software, I find that that recipe of scale doesn’t work for other industries.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><a name="career"></a>
</p><p>
<strong>It’s funny to hear you say that, because your early work was at a consumer-facing company with millions of users.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Over a decade ago, when I proposed starting the <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Brain</a> project to use Google’s compute infrastructure to build very large neural networks, it was a controversial step. One very senior person pulled me aside and warned me that starting Google Brain would be bad for my career. I think he felt that the action couldn’t just be in scaling up, and that I should instead focus on architecture innovation.

	“In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn.”<br/>
	—Andrew Ng, CEO & Founder, Landing AI
</p><p>
	I remember when my students and I published the first 
	<a href="https://nips.cc/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NeurIPS</a> workshop paper advocating using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CUDA</a>, a platform for processing on GPUs, for deep learning—a different senior person in AI sat me down and said, “CUDA is really complicated to program. As a programming paradigm, this seems like too much work.” I did manage to convince him; the other person I did not convince.
</p><p>
<strong>I expect they’re both convinced now.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> I think so, yes.
</p><p>
	Over the past year as I’ve been speaking to people about the data-centric AI movement, I’ve been getting flashbacks to when I was speaking to people about deep learning and scalability 10 or 15 years ago. In the past year, I’ve been getting the same mix of “there’s nothing new here” and “this seems like the wrong direction.”
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><a name="defining"></a>
</p><p>
<strong>How do you define data-centric AI, and why do you consider it a movement?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> Data-centric AI is the discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to successfully build an AI system. For an AI system, you have to implement some algorithm, say a neural network, in code and then train it on your data set. The dominant paradigm over the last decade was to download the data set while you focus on improving the code. Thanks to that paradigm, over the last decade deep learning networks have improved significantly, to the point where for a lot of applications the code—the neural network architecture—is basically a solved problem. So for many practical applications, it’s now more productive to hold the neural network architecture fixed, and instead find ways to improve the data.
</p><p>
	When I started speaking about this, there were many practitioners who, completely appropriately, raised their hands and said, “Yes, we’ve been doing this for 20 years.” This is the time to take the things that some individuals have been doing intuitively and make it a systematic engineering discipline.
</p><p>
	The data-centric AI movement is much bigger than one company or group of researchers. My collaborators and I organized a 
	<a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/workshop/21860" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data-centric AI workshop at NeurIPS</a>, and I was really delighted at the number of authors and presenters that showed up.
</p><p>
<strong>You often talk about companies or institutions that have only a small amount of data to work with. How can data-centric AI help them?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>You hear a lot about vision systems built with millions of images—I once built a face recognition system using 350 million images. Architectures built for hundreds of millions of images don’t work with only 50 images. But it turns out, if you have 50 really good examples, you can build something valuable, like a defect-inspection system. In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn.
</p><p>
<strong>When you talk about training a model with just 50 images, does that really mean you’re taking an existing model that was trained on a very large data set and fine-tuning it? Or do you mean a brand new model that’s designed to learn only from that small data set?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Let me describe what Landing AI does. When doing visual inspection for manufacturers, we often use our own flavor of <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/how-retinanet-works/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RetinaNet</a>. It is a pretrained model. Having said that, the pretraining is a small piece of the puzzle. What’s a bigger piece of the puzzle is providing tools that enable the manufacturer to pick the right set of images [to use for fine-tuning] and label them in a consistent way. There’s a very practical problem we’ve seen spanning vision, NLP, and speech, where even human annotators don’t agree on the appropriate label. For big data applications, the common response has been: If the data is noisy, let’s just get a lot of data and the algorithm will average over it. But if you can develop tools that flag where the data’s inconsistent and give you a very targeted way to improve the consistency of the data, that turns out to be a more efficient way to get a high-performing system.
</p><p class="pull-quote">
	“Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity.”<br/>
	—Andrew Ng
</p><p>
	For example, if you have 10,000 images where 30 images are of one class, and those 30 images are labeled inconsistently, one of the things we do is build tools to draw your attention to the subset of data that’s inconsistent. So you can very quickly relabel those images to be more consistent, and this leads to improvement in performance.
</p><p>
<strong>Could this focus on high-quality data help with bias in data sets? If you’re able to curate the data more before training?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> Very much so. Many researchers have pointed out that biased data is one factor among many leading to biased systems. There have been many thoughtful efforts to engineer the data. At the NeurIPS workshop, <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Olga Russakovsky</a> gave a really nice talk on this. At the main NeurIPS conference, I also really enjoyed <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/invited-talk/22281" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mary Gray’s presentation,</a> which touched on how data-centric AI is one piece of the solution, but not the entire solution. New tools like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/datasheets-for-datasets/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Datasheets for Datasets</a> also seem like an important piece of the puzzle.
</p><p>
	One of the powerful tools that data-centric AI gives us is the ability to engineer a subset of the data. Imagine training a machine-learning system and finding that its performance is okay for most of the data set, but its performance is biased for just a subset of the data. If you try to change the whole neural network architecture to improve the performance on just that subset, it’s quite difficult. But if you can engineer a subset of the data you can address the problem in a much more targeted way.
</p><p>
<strong>When you talk about engineering the data, what do you mean exactly?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>In AI, data cleaning is important, but the way the data has been cleaned has often been in very manual ways. In computer vision, someone may visualize images through a <a href="https://jupyter.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jupyter notebook</a> and maybe spot the problem, and maybe fix it. But I’m excited about tools that allow you to have a very large data set, tools that draw your attention quickly and efficiently to the subset of data where, say, the labels are noisy. Or to quickly bring your attention to the one class among 100 classes where it would benefit you to collect more data. Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity.
</p><p>
	For example, I once figured out that a speech-recognition system was performing poorly when there was car noise in the background. Knowing that allowed me to collect more data with car noise in the background, rather than trying to collect more data for everything, which would have been expensive and slow.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><a name="synthetic"></a>
</p><p>
<strong>What about using synthetic data, is that often a good solution?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>I think synthetic data is an important tool in the tool chest of data-centric AI. At the NeurIPS workshop, <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anima Anandkumar</a> gave a great talk that touched on synthetic data. I think there are important uses of synthetic data that go beyond just being a preprocessing step for increasing the data set for a learning algorithm. I’d love to see more tools to let developers use synthetic data generation as part of the closed loop of iterative machine learning development.
</p><p>
<strong>Do you mean that synthetic data would allow you to try the model on more data sets?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Not really. Here’s an example. Let’s say you’re trying to detect defects in a smartphone casing. There are many different types of defects on smartphones. It could be a scratch, a dent, pit marks, discoloration of the material, other types of blemishes. If you train the model and then find through error analysis that it’s doing well overall but it’s performing poorly on pit marks, then synthetic data generation allows you to address the problem in a more targeted way. You could generate more data just for the pit-mark category.

</p><p>
	Synthetic data generation is a very powerful tool, but there are many simpler tools that I will often try first. Such as data augmentation, improving labeling consistency, or just asking a factory to collect more data.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><a name="work"></a>
</p><p>
<strong>To make these issues more concrete, can you walk me through an example? When a company approaches <a href="https://landing.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Landing AI</a> and says it has a problem with visual inspection, how do you onboard them and work toward deployment?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>When a customer approaches us we usually have a conversation about their inspection problem and look at a few images to verify that the problem is feasible with computer vision. Assuming it is, we ask them to upload the data to the <a href="https://landing.ai/platform/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LandingLens</a> platform. We often advise them on the methodology of data-centric AI and help them label the data.
</p><p>
	One of the foci of Landing AI is to empower manufacturing companies to do the machine learning work themselves. A lot of our work is making sure the software is fast and easy to use. Through the iterative process of machine learning development, we advise customers on things like how to train models on the platform, when and how to improve the labeling of data so the performance of the model improves. Our training and software supports them all the way through deploying the trained model to an edge device in the factory.
</p><p>
<strong>How do you deal with changing needs? If products change or lighting conditions change in the factory, can the model keep up?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> It varies by manufacturer. There is data drift in many contexts. But there are some manufacturers that have been running the same manufacturing line for 20 years now with few changes, so they don’t expect changes in the next five years. Those stable environments make things easier. For other manufacturers, we provide tools to flag when there’s a significant data-drift issue. I find it really important to empower manufacturing customers to correct data, retrain, and update the model. Because if something changes and it’s 3 a.m. in the United States, I want them to be able to adapt their learning algorithm right away to maintain operations.
</p><p>
	In the consumer software Internet, we could train a handful of machine-learning models to serve a billion users. In manufacturing, you might have 10,000 manufacturers building 10,000 custom AI models. The challenge is, how do you do that without Landing AI having to hire 10,000 machine learning specialists?
</p><p>
<strong>So you’re saying that to make it scale, you have to empower customers to do a lot of the training and other work.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Yes, exactly! This is an industry-wide problem in AI, not just in manufacturing. Look at health care. Every hospital has its own slightly different format for electronic health records. How can every hospital train its own custom AI model? Expecting every hospital’s IT personnel to invent new neural-network architectures is unrealistic. The only way out of this dilemma is to build tools that empower the customers to build their own models by giving them tools to engineer the data and express their domain knowledge. That’s what Landing AI is executing in computer vision, and the field of AI needs other teams to execute this in other domains.
</p><p>
<strong>Is there anything else you think it’s important for people to understand about the work you’re doing or the data-centric AI movement?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>In the last decade, the biggest shift in AI was a shift to deep learning. I think it’s quite possible that in this decade the biggest shift will be to data-centric AI. With the maturity of today’s neural network architectures, I think for a lot of the practical applications the bottleneck will be whether we can efficiently get the data we need to develop systems that work well. The data-centric AI movement has tremendous energy and momentum across the whole community. I hope more researchers and developers will jump in and work on it.

Engineers and designers can do only so much to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ibm-introduces-the-worlds-first-2nm-node-chip" target="_self">miniaturize transistors</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cerebras-giant-ai-chip-now-has-a-trillions-more-transistors" target="_self">pack as many of them as possible into chips</a>. So they’re turning to other approaches to chip design, incorporating technologies like AI into the process.</p><p>Samsung, for instance, is <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/processing-in-dram-accelerates-ai" target="_self">adding AI to its memory chips</a> to enable processing in memory, thereby saving energy and speeding up machine learning. Speaking of speed, Google’s TPU V4 AI chip has <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/heres-how-googles-tpu-v4-ai-chip-stacked-up-in-training-tests" target="_self">doubled its processing power</a> compared with that of  its previous version.</p><p>But AI holds still more promise and potential for the semiconductor industry. To better understand how AI is set to revolutionize chip design, we spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-gorr-phd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heather Gorr</a>, senior product manager for <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MathWorks</a>’ MATLAB platform.</p><p><strong>How is AI currently being used to design the next generation of chips?</strong></p><p><strong>Heather Gorr:</strong> AI is such an important technology because it’s involved in most parts of the cycle, including the design and manufacturing process. There’s a lot of important applications here, even in the general process engineering where we want to optimize things. I think defect detection is a big one at all phases of the process, especially in manufacturing. But even thinking ahead in the design process, [AI now plays a significant role] when you’re designing the light and the sensors and all the different components. There’s a lot of anomaly detection and fault mitigation that you really want to consider.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-left" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;">

So, looking back at that historical data of when you’ve had those moments where maybe it took a bit longer than expected to manufacture something, you can take a look at all of that data and use AI to try to identify the proximate cause or to see  something that might jump out even in the processing and design phases. We think of AI oftentimes as a predictive tool, or as a robot doing something, but a lot of times you get a lot of insight from the data through AI.</p><p><strong>What are the benefits of using AI for chip design?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Historically, we’ve seen a lot of physics-based modeling, which is a very intensive process. We want to do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reduced order model</a>, where instead of solving such a computationally expensive and extensive model, we can do something a little cheaper. You could create a surrogate model, so to speak, of that physics-based model, use the data, and then do your <a href="https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/idmtools/parameter-sweeps.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">parameter sweeps</a>, your optimizations, your <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/monte-carlo-simulation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Monte Carlo simulations</a> using the surrogate model. That takes a lot less time computationally than solving the physics-based equations directly. So, we’re seeing that benefit in many ways, including the efficiency and economy that are the results of iterating quickly on the experiments and the simulations that will really help in the design.</p><p><strong>So it’s like having a digital twin in a sense?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Exactly. That’s pretty much what people are doing, where you have the physical system model and the experimental data. Then, in conjunction, you have this other model that you could tweak and tune and try different parameters and experiments that let sweep through all of those different situations and come up with a better design in the end.</p><p><strong>So, it’s going to be more efficient and, as you said, cheaper?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Yeah, definitely. Especially in the experimentation and design phases, where you’re trying different things. That’s obviously going to yield dramatic cost savings if you’re actually manufacturing and producing [the chips]. You want to simulate, test, experiment as much as possible without making something using the actual process engineering.</p><p><strong>We’ve talked about the benefits. How about the drawbacks?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr: </strong>The [AI-based experimental models] tend to not be as accurate as physics-based models. Of course, that’s why you do many simulations and parameter sweeps. But that’s also the benefit of having that digital twin, where you can keep that in mind—it's not going to be as accurate as that precise model that we’ve developed over the years.</p><p>Both chip design and manufacturing are system intensive; you have to consider every little part. And that can be really challenging. It's a case where you might have models to predict something and different parts of it, but you still need to bring it all together.</p><p>One of the other things to think about too is that you need the data to build the models. You have to incorporate data from all sorts of different sensors and different sorts of teams, and so that heightens the challenge.</p><p><strong>How can engineers use AI to better prepare and extract insights from hardware or sensor data?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr: </strong>We always think about using AI to predict something or do some robot task, but you can use AI to come up with patterns and pick out things you might not have noticed before on your own. People will use AI when they have high-frequency data coming from many different sensors, and a lot of times it’s useful to explore the frequency domain and things like data synchronization or resampling. Those can be really challenging if you’re not sure where to start.</p><p>One of the things I would say is, use the tools that are available. There’s a vast community of people working on these things, and you can find lots of examples [of applications and techniques] on <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MATLAB Central</a>, where people have shared nice examples, even little apps they’ve created. I think many of us are buried in data and just not sure what to do with it, so definitely take advantage of what’s already out there in the community. You can explore and see what makes sense to you, and bring in that balance of domain knowledge and the insight you get from the tools and AI.</p><p><strong>What should engineers and designers consider wh</strong><strong>en using AI for chip design?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> Think through what problems you’re trying to solve or what insights you might hope to find, and try to be clear about that. Consider all of the different components, and document and test each of those different parts. Consider all of the people involved, and explain and hand off in a way that is sensible for the whole team.</p><p><strong>How do you think AI will affect chip designers’ jobs?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr:</strong> It’s going to free up a lot of human capital for more advanced tasks. We can use AI to reduce waste, to optimize the materials, to optimize the design, but then you still have that human involved whenever it comes to decision-making. I think it’s a great example of people and technology working hand in hand. It’s also an industry where all people involved—even on the manufacturing floor—need to have some level of understanding of what’s happening, so this is a great industry for advancing AI because of how we test things and how we think about them before we put them on the chip.</p><p><strong>How do you envision the future of AI and chip design?</strong></p><p><strong>Gorr</strong><strong>:</strong> It's very much dependent on that human element—involving people in the process and having that interpretable model. We can do many things with the mathematical minutiae of modeling, but it comes down to how people are using it, how everybody in the process is understanding and applying it. Communication and involvement of people of all skill levels in the process are going to be really important. We’re going to see less of those superprecise predictions and more transparency of information, sharing, and that digital twin—not only using AI but also using our human knowledge and all of the work that many people have done over the years.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 14:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-chip-design-matlab</guid><category>Chip fabrication</category><category>Moore’s law</category><category>Chip design</category><category>Ai</category><category>Matlab</category><category>Digital twins</category><dc:creator>Rina Diane Caballar</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/layered-rendering-of-colorful-semiconductor-wafers-with-a-bright-white-light-sitting-on-one.jpg?id=29285079&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Atomically Thin Materials Significantly Shrink Qubits</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/2d-hbn-qubit</link><description><![CDATA[

Of these challenges two critical issues stand out: miniaturization and qubit quality.</p><p>IBM has adopted the superconducting qubit road map of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ibms-envisons-the-road-to-quantum-computing-like-an-apollo-mission" target="_self">reaching a 1,121-qubit processor by 2023</a>, leading to the expectation that 1,000 qubits with today’s qubit form factor is feasible. However, current approaches will require very large chips (50 millimeters on a side, or larger) at the scale of small wafers, or the use of chiplets on multichip modules. While this approach will work, the aim is to attain a better path toward scalability.</p><p>Now researchers at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-021-01187-w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIT have been able to both reduce the size of the qubits</a> and done so in a way that reduces the interference that occurs between neighboring qubits. The MIT researchers have increased the number of superconducting qubits that can be added onto a device by a factor of 100.</p><p>“We are addressing both qubit miniaturization and quality,” said <a href="https://equs.mit.edu/william-d-oliver/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William Oliver</a>, the director for the <a href="https://cqe.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Quantum Engineering</a> at MIT. “Unlike conventional transistor scaling, where only the number really matters, for qubits, large numbers are not sufficient, they must also be high-performance. Sacrificing performance for qubit number is not a useful trade in quantum computing. They must go hand in hand.”</p><p>The key to this big increase in qubit density and reduction of interference comes down to the use of two-dimensional materials, in particular the 2D insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The MIT researchers demonstrated that a few atomic monolayers of hBN can be stacked to form the insulator in the capacitors of a superconducting qubit.</p><p>Just like other capacitors, the capacitors in these superconducting circuits take the form of a sandwich in which an insulator material is sandwiched between two metal plates. The big difference for these capacitors is that the superconducting circuits can operate only at extremely low temperatures—less than 0.02 degrees above absolute zero (-273.15 °C).</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-left" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: left;">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption..." style="max-width: 100%;">Superconducting qubits are measured at temperatures as low as 20 millikelvin in a dilution refrigerator.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit..." style="max-width: 100%;">Nathan Fiske/MIT</small></p><p>In that environment, insulating materials that are available for the job, such as PE-CVD silicon oxide or silicon nitride, have quite a few defects that are too lossy for quantum computing applications. To get around these material shortcomings, most superconducting circuits use what are called coplanar capacitors. In these capacitors, the plates are positioned laterally to one another, rather than on top of one another.</p><p>As a result, the intrinsic silicon substrate below the plates and to a smaller degree the vacuum above the plates serve as the capacitor dielectric. Intrinsic silicon is chemically pure and therefore has few defects, and the large size dilutes the electric field at the plate interfaces, all of which leads to a low-loss capacitor. The lateral size of each plate in this open-face design ends up being quite large (typically 100 by 100 micrometers) in order to achieve the required capacitance.</p><p>In an effort to move away from the large lateral configuration, the MIT researchers embarked on a search for an insulator that has very few defects and is compatible with superconducting capacitor plates.</p><p>“We chose to study hBN because it is the most widely used insulator in 2D material research due to its cleanliness and chemical inertness,” said colead author <a href="https://equs.mit.edu/joel-wang/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joel Wang</a>, a research scientist in the Engineering Quantum Systems group of the MIT Research Laboratory for Electronics. </p><p>On either side of the hBN, the MIT researchers used the 2D superconducting material, niobium diselenide. One of the trickiest aspects of fabricating the capacitors was working with the niobium diselenide, which oxidizes in seconds when exposed to air, according to Wang. This necessitates that the assembly of the capacitor occur in a glove box filled with argon gas.</p><p>While this would seemingly complicate the scaling up of the production of these capacitors, Wang doesn’t regard this as a limiting factor.</p><p>“What determines the quality factor of the capacitor are the two interfaces between the two materials,” said Wang. “Once the sandwich is made, the two interfaces are “sealed” and we don’t see any noticeable degradation over time when exposed to the atmosphere.”</p><p>This lack of degradation is because around 90 percent of the electric field is contained within the sandwich structure, so the oxidation of the outer surface of the niobium diselenide does not play a significant role anymore. This ultimately makes the capacitor footprint much smaller, and it accounts for the reduction in cross talk between the neighboring qubits.</p><p>“The main challenge for scaling up the fabrication will be the wafer-scale growth of hBN and 2D superconductors like [niobium diselenide], and how one can do wafer-scale stacking of these films,” added Wang.</p><p>Wang believes that this research has shown 2D hBN to be a good insulator candidate for superconducting qubits. He says that the groundwork the MIT team has done will serve as a road map for using other hybrid 2D materials to build superconducting circuits.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 16:12:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/2d-hbn-qubit</guid><category>Qubits</category><category>Mit</category><category>Ibm</category><category>Superconducting qubits</category><category>Hexagonal boron nitride</category><category>2d materials</category><category>Quantum computing</category><dc:creator>Dexter Johnson</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-golden-square-package-holds-a-small-processor-sitting-on-top-is-a-metal-square-with-mit-etched-into-it.jpg?id=29281587&amp;width=980"></media:content></item></channel></rss>
