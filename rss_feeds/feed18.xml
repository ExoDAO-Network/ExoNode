<p>The <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3673373/windows-11-22h2-small-but-welcome-changes.html">Windows 11 2022 Update has been released</a>, but behind the scenes, Microsoft is constantly working to improve the newest version of Windows. The company frequently rolls out public preview builds to members of its Windows Insider Program, allowing them to test out — and even help shape — upcoming features.</p><p>The Windows Insider program is divided into three channels:</p><ul>
<li>The <strong>Dev Channel</strong> is where new features are introduced for initial testing, regardless of which Windows release they’ll eventually end up in. This channel is best for technical users and developers and builds in it may be unstable and buggy.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Beta Channel</strong>, you’ll get more polished features that will be deployed in the next major Windows release. This channel is best for early adopters, and Microsoft says your feedback in this channel will have the most impact.</li>
<li>The <strong>Release Preview Channel</strong> typically doesn’t see action until shortly before a new feature update is rolled out. It’s meant for final testing of an upcoming release and is best for those who want the most stable builds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Beta and Release Preview Channels also receive bug-fix builds for the currently shipping version of Windows 11.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3623370/windows-11-insider-previews-whats-in-latest-build.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>There’s a lot of tech industry excitement these days about tools like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DALL-E</a> that fall into a class called generative AI. Generative AI looks at existing work and generates a result that seems unique,  but is actually derived from what it’s viewed. (I’d argue this is how most people produce work — by taking what they’ve learned from others to create a skill set that can be used independently of those earlier references.)</p><p>Like many others, I really enjoy working out the concept of something I want to create, but I get bored quickly when executing that concept. This reminds me of an old friend who bought a knock-off Ferrari kit car. Coming up with the dream of driving it was easy and fun, but actually putting in the thousands of hours to build it was too much. It sat in his garage, unbuilt. With these tools, you can focus on the fun part of creation (coming up with an idea), and then let the tools step in to do the tedious part of bringing everything to fruition. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3685371/the-productivity-promise-and-perils-with-generative-ai.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Accessibility in our age of mobile technology is a pretty inspiring thing.</p><p>I mean, think about it: These powerful little computers we carry around in our purses and pantaloon pockets have the potential to open up all sorts of futuristic possibilities. Their effects can be downright <em>life-changing </em>for folks with issues like impaired hearing or limited vision — and in the grand scheme of things, those sorts of advancements are far more meaningful than any random phone feature we use to organize our lives or save ourselves a few seconds here and there.</p><p>Here's the cool part, though: Those two areas don't <em>have</em> to be mutually exclusive. Some of Android's most interesting accessibility options are poised to both help those who truly need 'em <em>and</em> be handy in a way that can benefit anyone. They work for accessibility, sure, but they're also valuable for far more mundane productivity gains.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3346010/android-accessibility.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>As Amazon looks to shed staff around the world, it is heading for a showdown with worker and government representatives over its hotly contested Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) in India.</p><p>Workers say that the program has not been truly voluntary, but rather a way of enacting layoffs without going through legally sanctioned procedures. On its part, Amazon has said that none of the workers who have left the company in the last few months have been laid off, but rather have participated voluntarily in the VSP.</p><p>The company has not revealed the number of workers it says have recently left the company via the VSP.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pune Labor Commission has summoned representatives from Amazon India and the Pune-based Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), a workers rights association, to a joint meeting on January 17.
