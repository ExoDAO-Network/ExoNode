Glenn McDonald had chosen his title himself, preferring “alchemy,” with its esoteric associations, over the now-ordinary “data science.” His job, as he described it from the stage, was “to use math and typing and computers to help people understand and discover music.”&nbsp;</p><p>McDonald practiced his alchemy for the music streaming service Spotify, where he worked to transmute the base stuff of big data — logs of listener interactions, bits of digital audio files, and whatever else he could get his hands on — into valuable gold: products that might attract and retain paying customers. The mysterious power of McDonald’s alchemy lay in the way that ordinary data, if processed correctly, appeared to transform from thin interactional traces into thick cultural significance.</p><p>It was 2014, and McDonald was presenting at the Pop Conference, an annual gathering of music critics and academics held in a crumpled, Frank Gehry–designed heap of a building in the center of Seattle. I was on the other side of the country, and I followed along online. That year, the conference’s theme was “Music and Mobility,” and Mc Donald started his talk by narrating his personal musical journey, playing samples as he went. “When I was a kid,” he began, “you discovered music by holding still and waiting.” As a child at home, he listened to the folk music his parents played on the stereo. But as he grew up, his listening expanded: the car radio offered heavy metal and new wave; the internet revealed a world of new and obscure genres to explore. Where once he had been stuck in place, a passive observer of music that happened to go by, he would eventually measure the progress of his life by his ever broadening musical horizons. McDonald had managed to turn this passion into a profession, working to help others explore what he called “the world of music,” which on-demand streaming services had made more accessible than ever before.</p><p>Elsewhere, McDonald (2013) would describe the world of music as though it were a landscape: “Follow any path, no matter how unlikely and untrodden it appears, and you’ll find a hidden valley with a hundred bands who’ve lived there for years, reconstructing the music world in methodically- and idiosyncratically-altered miniature, as in Australian hip hop, Hungarian pop, microhouse or Viking metal.”&nbsp;</p><p>Travelers through the world of music would find familiarity and surprise — sounds they never would have imagined and songs they adored. McDonald marveled at this new ability to hear music from around the world, from Scotland, Australia, or Malawi. “The perfect music for you may come from the other side of the planet,” he said, but this was not a problem: “in music, we have the teleporter.” On-demand streaming provided a kind of musical mobility, which allowed listeners to travel across the world of music instantaneously.</p><p>However, he suggested, repeating the common refrain, the scale of this world could be overwhelming and hard to navigate. “For this new world to actually be appreciable,” McDonald said, “we have to find ways to map this space and then build machines to take you through it along interesting paths.” The recommender systems offered by companies like Spotify were the machines. McDonald’s recent work had focused on the maps, or as he described them in another talk: a “kind of thin layer of vaguely intelligible order over the writhing, surging, insatiably expanding information-space-beast of all the world’s music.”</p><p>Although his language may have been unusually poetic, McDonald was expressing an understanding of musical variety that is widely shared among the makers of music recommendation: Music exists in a kind of space. That space is, in one sense, fairly ordinary — like a landscape that you might walk through, encountering new things as you go. But in another sense, this space is deeply weird: behind the valleys and hills, there is a writhing, surging beast, constantly growing and tying points in the space together, infinitely connected. The music space can seem as natural as the mountains visible from the top of the Space Needle; but it can also seem like the man-made topological jumble at its base. It is organic and intuitive; it is technological and chaotic.</p><p>Spatial metaphors provide a dominant language for thinking about differences among the makers of music recommendation, as they do in machine learning and among Euro-American cultures more generally. Within these contexts, it is easy to imagine certain, similar things as gathered <em>over here</em>, while other, different things cluster <em>over there</em>. In conversations with engineers, it is very common to find the music space summoned into existence through gestures, which envelop the speakers in an imaginary environment populated by brief pinches in the air and organized by waves of the hand. One genre is on your left, another on your right. On whiteboards and windows scattered around the office, you might find the music space rendered in two dimensions, containing an array of points that cluster and spread across the plane.</p><p>In the music space, music that is similar is nearby. If you find yourself within such a space, you should be surrounded by music that you like. To find more of it, you need only to look around you and move. In the music space, genres are like regions, playlists are like pathways, and tastes are like drifting, archipelagic territories. Your new favorite song may lie just over the horizon.</p><p>But despite their familiarity, spaces like these are strange: similarities can be found anywhere, and points that seemed far apart might suddenly become adjacent. If you ask, you will learn that all of these spatial representations are mere reductions of something much more complex, of a space comprising not two or three dimensions but potentially thousands of them. This is McDonald’s information-space-beast, a mathematical abstraction that stretches human spatial intuitions past their breaking point.</p><p>Spaces like these, generically called “similarity spaces,” are the symbolic terrain on which most machine learning works. To classify data points or recommend items, machine-learning systems typically locate them in spaces, gather them into clusters, measure distances among them, and draw boundaries between them. Machine learning, as the cultural theorist Adrian Mackenzie (2017, 63) has argued, “renders all differences as distances and directions of movement.” So while the music space is in one sense an informal metaphor (the landscape of musical variation) in another sense it is a highly technical formal object (the mathematical substrate of algorithmic recommendation).</p><p>Spatial understandings of data travel through technical infrastructures and everyday conversation; they are at once a form of metaphorical expression and a concrete computational practice. In other words, “space” here is both a formalism — a restricted, technical concept that facilitates precision through abstraction — and what the anthropologist Stefan Helmreich (2016, 468) calls an informalism — a less disciplined metaphor that travels alongside formal techniques. In practice, it is often hard or impossible to separate technical specificity from its metaphorical accompaniment. When the makers of music recommendation speak of space, they speak at once figuratively and technically.</p><p>For many critics, this “geometric rationality” (Blanke 2018) of machine learning makes it anathema to “culture” per se: it quantifies qualities, rationalizes passions, and plucks cultural objects from their everyday social contexts to relocate them in the sterile isolation of a computational grid. Mainstream cultural anthropology, for instance, has long defined itself in opposition to formalisms like these, which seem to lack the thickness, sensitivity, or adequacy to lived experience that we seek through ethnography. As the political theorists Louise Amoore and Volha Piotukh (2015, 361) suggest, such analytics “reduce heterogeneous forms of life and data to homogeneous spaces of calculation.”</p><p>To use the geographer Henri Lefebvre’s (1992) terms, similarity spaces are clear examples of “abstract space” — a kind of representational space in which everything is measurable and quantified, controlled by central authorities in the service of capital. The media theorist Robert Prey (2015, 16), applying Lefebvre’s framework to streaming music, suggests that people like McDonald — “data analysts, programmers and engineers” — are primarily concerned with the abstract, conceived space of calculation and measurement. Conceived space, in Lefebvrian thought, is parasitic on social, lived space, which Prey associates with the listeners who resist and reinterpret the work of technologists. The spread of abstract space under capitalism portends, in this framework, “the devastating conquest of the lived by the conceived” (Wilson 2013).</p><p>But for the people who work with it, the music space does not feel like a sterile grid, even at its most mathematical. The makers of music recommendation do not limit themselves to the refined abstractions of conceived space. Over the course of their training, they learn to experience the music space as ordinary and inhabitable, despite its underlying strangeness. The music space is as intuitive as a landscape to be walked across and as alien as a complex, highly dimensional object of engineering. To use an often- problematized distinction from cultural geography, they treat “space” like “place,” as though the abstract, homogeneous grid were a kind of livable local environment.</p><p>Similarity spaces are the result of many decisions; they are by no means ``natural,” and people like McDonald are aware that the choices they make can profoundly rearrange them. Yet spatial metaphorizing, moving across speech, gesture, illustration, and computation, helps make the patterns in cultural data feel real. A confusion between maps and territories— between malleable representations and objective terrains— is productive for people who are at once interested in creating objective knowledge and concerned with accounting for their own subjective influence on the process. These spatial understandings alter the meaning of musical concepts like genre or social phenomena like taste, rendering them as forms of clustering.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-computing-taste-nick-seaver-university-of-chicago-press-153010545.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">86289d7f-c120-4bad-b0b0-eb7da30d2150</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 15:30:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1673627378</ingested><modified>2023-01-13T16:29:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/285a8d90-929c-11ed-9ff7-9d000e6f68be" width="6500" height="3656" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/285a8d90-929c-11ed-9ff7-9d000e6f68be" width="6500" height="3656" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[your_photo via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Technology network background concept.

The government will begin enforcing the legislation in October 2023. In addition to some plastics, the ban will cover single-use trays and certain types of polystyrene cups and food containers but will exempt plates, trays and bowls included with supermarket-ready meals; the government intends to target those through a separate plan that incentives manufacturers to meet higher recycling standards.</p><p>According to one estimate cited by the environment ministry, English consumers use about 2.7 billion items of single-use cutlery every year, and only about 10 percent of those are recycled. The department said 95 percent of people it consulted before today’s announcement were in favor of a ban. &quot;We have listened to the public and these new single-use plastics bans will continue our vital work to protect the environment for future generations,&quot; said Environment Secretary Thérèse Coffey.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230114-raft-of-single-use-plastic-items-to-be-banned-in-england-govt">Per AFP</a>, Scotland and Wales previously passed similar legislation. It’s also worth noting, England already restricts the sale of other single-use items, including straws and cotton swabs. Additionally, the environment ministry is considering measures that would target other “problematic plastic items.” Specifically, the government could also ban wet wipes and tobacco filters or mandate package labeling designed to show consumers how to dispose of those items correctly.</p><p>The ban on disposable plates and cutlery is part of a broader push by governments across the world to curb the production and use of single-use plastics. Last March, the United Nations began working on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/un-agrees-plastic-pollution-treaty-200458603.html">first-ever global plastic pollution treaty</a>. While the agreement won’t be complete until 2024 at the earliest, it could be among the most significant efforts to curb climate change since the Paris agreement in 2015.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/england-banning-the-sale-of-some-single-use-plastics-222344569.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4781fb32-c24b-40d0-9009-995eda1d724c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 22:23:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1673735101</ingested><modified>2023-01-14T22:25:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/b990c960-9458-11ed-b57f-f3c0c6e64bb8" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/b990c960-9458-11ed-b57f-f3c0c6e64bb8" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Matt Keeble - PA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Giant Plastic Tap by artist and activist Benjamin Von Wong which is a giant tap sculpture spewing out single-use plastic waste to raise awareness of the root cause of the plastic problem: Plastic production, during the Great Britain Sail Grand Prix in Plymouth.

According to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/soundhound-lays-off-half-employees-pitiful-severance-1849987534"><em><ins>Gizmodo</ins></em></a>, the firm laid off about 200 employees last week as part of a company-wide restructuring. If <em>Gizmodo’s</em> reporting is accurate, the mass layoffs would mark the second staff reduction SoundHound has undertaken in less than a year. In November, the company reportedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/10/soundhound-layoffs/"><ins>laid off 10 percent of its workforce</ins></a>. Before the first round of cuts, SoundHound employed approximately 450 people.</p><p>A trio of former employees who spoke to <em>Gizmodo </em>described a “pitiful” severance package contingent on the company raising more money. They claim the package includes no healthcare and only two weeks of severance. The company did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment. SoundCloud went public via a special-purpose acquisition company in early 2022. According to data from <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/soundhound/company_financials"><ins>CrunchBase</ins></a>, the firm has raised more than $300 million to date. SoundHound customers include Pandora, Mercedes-Benz and Snap.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In an email obtained by <em>Gizmodo</em>, SoundHound CEO and co-founder Keyvan Mohajer blamed the layoffs on recent macroeconomic conditions. “When we set course in early 2021 to become publicly listed, high-tech companies like SoundHound were the darlings of the investor community. Companies who could achieve high growth, despite high costs, were seen as engines of a future economy, ” he wrote. “However, as a result of changing economic conditions, including high interest rates, rising inflation, and fears of recession, companies with our profile became much less desirable.” Mohajer reportedly went on to add investors “were concerned” SoundHound did “not have the heart to let go of its people.”</p><p>In the last few months, mass layoffs have been a frequent occurrence at many tech companies. At the start of November, Facebook parent Meta cut about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html"><ins>13 percent of its workforce</ins></a>, a move that saw more than 11,000 people lose their jobs.

Musk’s “<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776?s=20&amp;t=bI5TaM4bx9Dnc3ZFSwjp9w">funding secured</a>” tweet drew the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, eventually leading to a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776?s=20&amp;t=bI5TaM4bx9Dnc3ZFSwjp9w">$40 million settlement</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The shareholders involved in the suit allege Musk’s tweet affected Tesla’s stock price. They’re asking the court to order Musk to stop his “public campaign to present a contradictory and false narrative” of the episode. They say he should also be accountable for potential damages. The group <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-funding-secured-tweet-misleading-shareholder-lawsuit-205058441.html">won an early victory</a> last spring when District Judge Edward Chen concluded Musk had “recklessly made the statements with knowledge as to their falsity.”</p><p>Of the approximately 200 candidates the court is considering for the jury, 82 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of Musk in a pre-trial questionnaire. Ahead of the recent hearing, Alex Spiro, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-cuts-alex-spiro-232831688.html">Musk’s lawyer</a>, said the sheet showed “not only that a vast majority of potential jurors hold ill-will toward Mr. Musk. but that they are not afraid to declare it proudly and vividly to the court.” However, Judge Chen didn’t buy Spiro’s argument. Alluding to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elizabeth-holmes-sentencing-11-years-200015544.html">recently concluded Theranos trial</a>, Chen said a fellow judge in a nearby courthouse was able to assemble an “unbiased” jury to decide whether Elizabeth Holmes was guilty of criminal charges. He also dismissed the idea of moving the case to Texas, noting Tesla’s main office was located in California when Tesla shareholders sued Musk.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/court-rejects-elon-musk-request-to-move-tesla-shareholder-trial-out-of-san-francisco-171528898.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8d10cee-cd9d-444a-b117-f0569ca0250b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 17:15:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1673716629</ingested><modified>2023-01-14T17:17:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/056e3af0-942e-11ed-adbf-8c0a59f6602e" width="3261" height="2097" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/056e3af0-942e-11ed-adbf-8c0a59f6602e" width="3261" height="2097" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jonathan Ernst / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla CEO Elon Musk departs after taking the stand to defend Tesla Inc's 2016 deal for SolarCity in a case before the Delaware Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. July 12, 2021.

Further, the FAA had to deal with delays and other challenges after the system went back up due to a &quot;high system load.&quot;</p><p>The FAA is still verifying what caused the outage, but<em> The Post</em> said it&#39;s looking like the contractors truly made mistake and that there was no malicious intent behind their actions. Lawmakers are using this opportunity to put a spotlight on the FAA&#39;s outdated technology and to seek funding for upgrades. The computer system that failed and led to the outage is already three decades old, and according to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/12/tech/faa-notam-system-outage"><em>CNN</em></a>, it&#39;s also at least six years away from getting an upgrade.

With this Roomba, you’ll have to fill its reservoir with water and cleaning solution whenever you want the machine to mop your floors during a job.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thanks to iRobot’s latest technology, the Roomba will intelligently switch from vacuuming to mopping when it senses the appropriate type of flooring. In our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-combo-j7plus-hands-on-150010629.html?">brief time with the Combo j7+</a> thus far, we found it to be a solid cleaning machine made better by the controls you have in the iRobot mobile app. The most frustrating aspect is how frequently you may have to refill the reservoir, since it only takes 210 ml of liquid at a time.</p><p>If you don’t need mopping capabilities, the standard Roomba j7+ or the s9+ are good alternatives, especially when you can get them while on sale like this. Both come with clean bases, which allow the robo-vacs to automatically empty their dustbins after every job. You’ll only have to change the bag in the clean base every couple of months. Combine that with cleaning schedules that you can set in the mobile app and you may be able to leave your Roomba unattended as it sucks up dirt in your house, day in and day out, for weeks on end. The j7+ has obstacle avoidance technology that helps it detect things like pet poop and navigate around them as it cleans. The s9+, on the other hand, has the strongest suction power of any iRobot machine and it has a more corner-friendly design, too.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobots-roomba-combo-j7-plus-vacuum-and-mop-is-200-off-right-now-140029588.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a137f12-f9a2-4b5f-a6b6-94fe289f7c4d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 14:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1673621746</ingested><modified>2023-01-13T14:55:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/def4b1c0-65ce-11ed-bd7b-a64b66bfb07b" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/def4b1c0-65ce-11ed-bd7b-a64b66bfb07b" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the Roomba Combo J7+, complete with Clean Base.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roomba Combo J7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter opens early access signups for organization verification]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is now accepting signups for those who to be among the first to access the verification for organizations program.

In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/13/23553746/youtube-swearing-advertising-policy-change">statement</a> to <em>The Verge</em>, the Google brand says it's "making some adjustments" to a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9153642#Inappropriate_language&amp;zippy=%2Cguide-to-self-certification">profanity policy</a> it unveiled in November after receiving blowback from creators. The rule limits or removes ads on videos where someone swears within the first 15 seconds or has "focal usage" of rude words throughout, and is guaranteed to completely demonetize a clip if swearing either occurs in the first seven seconds or dominates the content.</p><p>While that policy wouldn't necessarily be an issue by itself, YouTube has been applying the criteria to videos uploaded before the new rule took effect. As <em>Kotaku</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-violence-profanity-policy-rtgame-moist-critical-1849971177">explains</a>, YouTube has demonetized old videos for channels like RTGame.

YouTube doesn't usually tell violators exactly what they did wrong, and creators tend to only learn about the updated policy after the service demonetizes their work. There are also concerns about inconsistency. Some videos are flagged while others aren't, and a remonetized video might lose that income a day later.

The alleged renders show the camera placement, colors and design of the new flagships, which Samsung is set to announce next month.</p><p>The S23 Ultra and Plus appear to share a metal frame and glass cover design. Both models appear in four colors: Phantom Black, Cotton Flower (cream), Botanic Green and Misty Lilac (pink or lavender). Those line up with colors <a href="https://winfuture.de/news,133991.html">leaked</a> this week by <em>WinFuture</em>, which should mean all S23 series models have the same color options. In other areas, the Ultra’s back appears flatter than its predecessor’s and has five camera sensors. Additionally, three of the S23 Ultra’s lenses (likely the primary, ultra-wide and 10x telephoto cameras) are bigger than the other two. The Ultra’s side buttons also sit slightly lower than those on its predecessor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to rumors, the Ultra will have a 200-megapixel main camera, a first for the Galaxy lineup. (Standard and Plus models should have 50 megapixels.) In addition, the Ultra is also rumored to have better autofocus and stabilization than its predecessor. Both phones are expected to run on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomms-snapdragon-8-gen-2-chip-offers-hardware-accelerated-ray-tracing-230008445.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> chipsets globally, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-may-drop-exynos-chips-from-galaxy-s23-175838796.html">change from Samsung’s familiar strategy</a> of using Snapdragon processors in the US and Exynos chips in Asia and Europe.</p><p>Samsung will announce all the details in its Galaxy Unpacked event on February 1st.

It's already testing the idea to weigh viewer interest. The platform could roll out the hub to more users later this year, according to <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3lvdXR1YmUtdGVzdHMtbmV3LWh1Yi1vZi1mcmVlLXN0cmVhbWluZy1jaGFubmVscy0xMTY3MzYzMTA0OCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiY2Q3NDQxZTgtNmM4Yy00NGFlLTgyNDgtZGRjNzZkZWExNjM0In0&amp;signature=AQAAATmXlM9NcOSVgbPwGsSwsYIlscm_eo02vLedmSs9xZVv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fyoutube-tests-new-hub-of-free-streaming-channels-11673631048" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal.</ins></em></a></p><p>If YouTube moves forward with the plan, it would be entering a market known in the industry as Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television, or FAST. Players in that space include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/roku/"><ins>Roku</ins></a>, Fox's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tubi/"><ins>Tubi</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/pluto%20tv/"><ins>Pluto TV,</ins></a> which is owned by Paramount Global (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-showtime-fourth-quarter-subscribers-010947475.html"><ins>formerly ViacomCBS</ins></a>). Depending on what content it offers and how it sets up the mooted channels, YouTube could end up pulling more attention away from those services.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>YouTube confirmed to the <em>Journal </em>that it's running a test in which a small number of users can watch ad-supported channels. “We’re always looking for new ways to provide viewers a central destination to more easily find, watch and share the content that matters most to them,” a spokeswoman said.</p><p>The service is said to have teamed up with the likes of Lionsgate, A+E Networks and FilmRise for the test. For media companies, such channels offer a way for them to earn revenue from content that might otherwise languish.</p><p>YouTube <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-17-youtube-free-movies.html">already offers ad-supported movies</a>, but this hub could give users a bigger platter of free films and shows to watch. Its channels could operate in a similar way to Pluto TV. That platform has channels dedicated to reruns of certain shows — such as <em>CSI, Doctor Who, South Park</em> and <em>Frasier </em>— along with ones for reality series, live news and even sports.</p><p>The mulled move into FAST aligns with YouTube's strategy of expanding into other video formats beyond the content that's traditionally associated with the platform. In November, it broke premium streaming channels out of YouTube TV and into its main app. Showtime, Starz, Paramount+ and AMC+ were among the first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-showtime-paramount-primetime-channels-tv-movies-170458712.html"><ins>Primetime Channels</ins></a>. More recently, YouTube <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-nfl-sunday-ticket-deal-155108503.html"><ins>locked down exclusive rights</ins></a> to the NFL's Sunday Ticket package in a multi-billion-dollar deal said to run for seven years.</p><p>YouTube already has the biggest share of TV viewing time among streaming services in the US, according to Nielsen. It beat Netflix for the third straight month in November with 8.8 percent of viewing time. Initiatives like the FAST channels and Sunday Ticket could help it lock up more mindshare and viewer attention.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-is-testing-a-hub-of-free-cable-style-channels-192518784.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cd7441e8-6c8c-44ae-8248-ddc76dea1634</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 19:25:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1673637920</ingested><modified>2023-01-13T19:25:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/5490af10-82d0-11ed-aff8-c7affd60a47e" width="3300" height="2196" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/5490af10-82d0-11ed-aff8-c7affd60a47e" width="3300" height="2196" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[POLAND - 2022/12/17: In this photo illustration, a YouTube logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

The hit Netflix series has drawn fans to the sport through its (sometimes manufactured) drama and beautiful cinematography. What you likely don’t know is that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-100th-race-130013162.html"><ins>Formula E</ins></a> has its version, albeit with shorter episodes and massively condensed storylines. Even still, <em>Formula E Unplugged </em>is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-preseason-testing-gen3-203026534.html"><ins>a great primer</ins></a> for the new season whether you’ll be watching the EV racing series for the first time or you’re a veteran fan.</p><p>Season two of <em>Unplugged, </em>which chronicles 2022’s Season 8 of Formula E,<em>&nbsp;</em>hit some broadcasters just before Christmas and all six episodes have made the rounds a few times here in the US already (CBS Sports Network). That’s a big change from season one’s 15 episodes which weren’t widely distributed and now live <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9BDzMZwJDA"><ins>on the Formula E YouTube channel</ins></a>. The other difference with this new season is the episodes are 30 minutes with commercials, slightly longer than the 10- to 15-minute entries in the previous installment. But even with some added time, many of the narratives are condensed to the point they’re hard to follow at times.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/9ab25980-935b-11ed-a9df-ec0d552c54b1" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="AUTODROMO HERMANOS RODRIGUEZ, MEXICO - FEBRUARY 12: Pascal Wehrlein (DEU), Tag Heuer Porsche, Porsche 99X Electric

Eventual series winner Stoffel Vandorne has to contend with the fact his teammate is the defending champion. The second episode offers a biographical look at Jaguar TCS’ Mitch Evans, including interviews with his family, his disappointing end to Season 7 and the title push in Season 8 that goes down to the very end.</p><p>In episode three, <em>Unplugged </em>covers two teams: TAG Heuer Porsche and ROKiT Venturi Racing. While one banked an early 1-2 finish in Season 8, the other had to contend with drama during its home race. This is the first taste of anything close to <em>Drive to Surive </em>drama. The fourth episode is all about the rookies as Dan Ticktum tries to put his past behind him, Antonio Giovinazzi looks to move on from F1 and American Oliver Askew tries his hand at a global series with the aid of British teammate Jake Dennis.</p><p>“<em>Formula E Unplugged</em> presents a realistic picture of life inside the paddock and helps fans to understand more about what makes us tick and where we are coming from,” said Ticktum, who drives for NIO 333 Racing. “I can be pretty fiery, but I think the ‘behind the scenes’ nature of <em>Unplugged</em> will show that sometimes there is a lot more to what drivers are going through than can be seen during races or on social media.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/b5cfe0c0-935b-11ed-bff7-17f117e05825" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="RIYADH STREET CIRCUIT, SAUDI ARABIA - JANUARY 29: Edoardo Mortara (CHE), ROKiT Venturi Racing, Silver Arrow 02 during the Diriyah ePrix II at Riyadh Street Circuit on Saturday January 29, 2022 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Things get heated on multiple occasions when both Jean-Éric Vergne and António Félix Da Costa have an equal desire to win. The final installment offers a look at the lead up to the final two rounds in South Korea. A four-way fight for the title, driver changes and a brief discussion of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-gen-e-electric-race-car-164542680.html"><ins>the Gen3 car</ins></a> round out the sixth episode.</p><p>There’s plenty to glean despite the compressed format. Even I learned new things as someone who follows the sport. However, <em>Unplugged </em>really focuses on the top four teams in the championship standings, with the exception of Porsche who looked strong at the outset and the episode about rookies. It would’ve been great to include Envision Racing’s Robin Frijns, who finished level on points in the driver’s standings with Di Grassi and Dennis. I can appreciate that Formula E likely has a limited budget for the show, which is why we only get a half dozen episodes, but it would’ve been nice to get to know the likes of Mahindra and Nissan eDAMS along the way (the latter is covered in S1). And there could’ve been an entire episode dedicated to the Gen3 car, especially when you consider how much more advanced it is (or eventually will be) over the Gen2 racer.</p><p>In the US, Formula E races are broadcast on CBS Sports Network and usually on a tape delay a few hours after the event. For example, the first race in Mexico City this weekend won’t air until 11:30PM ET Saturday night (race is at 2PM ET).

Meta said Voyager&#39;s actions have caused it &quot;to incur damages, including investigative costs, in an amount to be proven at trial.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta claims that Voyager scraped data from accounts belonging to &quot;employees of non-profit organizations, universities, news media organizations, healthcare facilities, the armed forces of the United States, and local, state, and federal government agencies, as well as full-time parents, retirees, and union members.&quot; The company noted <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/leading-the-fight-against-scraping-for-hire/"><ins>in a blog post</ins></a> it disabled accounts linked to Voyager and that filed the suit to enforce its terms and policies.</p><p>&quot;Companies like Voyager are part of an industry that provides scraping services to anyone regardless of the users they target and for what purpose, including as a way to profile people for criminal behavior,&quot; Jessica Romero, Meta&#39;s director of platform enforcement and litigation, wrote. &quot;This industry covertly collects information that people share with their community, family and friends, without oversight or accountability, and in a way that may implicate people’s civil rights.&quot;</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/17/police-surveillance-technology-voyager"><em><ins>The Guardian</ins></em></a> reported that the Los Angeles Police Department had tested Voyager&#39;s social media surveillance tools in 2019. The company is said to have told the department that police could use the software to track the accounts of a suspect&#39;s friends on social media, and that the system could predict crimes before they took place by making assumptions about a person&#39;s activity.</p><p>According to <em>The Guardian</em>, Voyager has suggested factors like Instagram usernames denoting Arab pride or tweeting about Islam could indicate someone is leaning toward extremism. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-02-11-predictive-policing.html"><ins>Other companies</ins></a>, such as <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/30/lapd-palantir-data-driven-policing/"><ins>Palantir</ins></a>, have worked on predictive policing tech. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/predictive-policing-privacy-civil-rights-dangers-133040971.html"><ins>Critics</ins></a> such as the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/technology-cant-predict-crime-it-can-only-weaponize-proximity-policing"><ins>Electronic Frontier Foundation</ins></a> claim that tech can&#39;t predict crime and that algorithms merely <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/#:~:text=For%20one%20thing%2C%20predictive%20algorithms,cause%20as%20a%20white%20person."><ins>perpetuate existing biases</ins></a>.</p><p>Data scraping is an issue that Meta has to take seriously.

Financial Services committee Chair Patrick McHenry (above) has <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408500">announced</a> a Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion that aims to set policy for technologies like cryptocurrency. Headed by Rep. French Hill, the panel hopes to establish &quot;clear rules of the road&quot; for federal regulators, create policies that bring financial technology to poorly served communities and bolster diversity and inclusiveness in digital assets.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/12/mchenry-reveals-house-crypto-panel-names-subcommittee-chairs-00077667">interview</a> with <em>Politico</em>, McHenry said he was creating the subcommittee to address a &quot;big hole&quot; in Financial Services&#39; approach to crypto issues. McHenry considers crypto regulation his main legislative priority, and panel chair Hill has led the GOP&#39;s investigation of a potential <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-federal-reserve-is-looking-closer-at-a-digital-currency-125534039.html">central bank-backed cryptocurrency</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The move comes as regulators struggle to find common ground on crypto. While agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) agree that digital assets are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-13-us-regulator-warning-on-digital-assets.html">subject to existing laws</a>, there have been tussles over just who should step in and when. Senators put forward a bill that would create a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-crypto-regulation-bill-responsible-financial-innovation-act-143136481.html">clear regulatory framework</a>, but it has been <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4356/all-info">stuck</a> in committee.</p><p>There&#39;s pressure on the House subcommittee to act. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-criminal-and-civil-charges-200410951.html">implosion of crypto giant FTX</a> has underscored the risks of letting the technology go unchecked. Officials are also investigating major industry names like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/celsius-network-freeze-state-securities-board-investigation-231238212.html">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sec-investigating-coinbase-over-unregistered-security-listings-123321443.html">Coinbase</a> over possible rule violations. Clearer rules would theoretically improve the federal government&#39;s responses to violations like these.</p><p>It&#39;s uncertain how effective the House panel will be. While there are crypto proponents across both main parties, the Democrats&#39; expanded control of the Senate could prevent bills from becoming law if there are any substantial disagreements. Both sections of Congress have to pass and reconcile legislation before it reaches the President&#39;s desk. The very existence of the subcommittee suggests that Congress is taking crypto more seriously, however, and there&#39;s a chance it could accelerate bipartisan efforts to oversee digital money and tokens.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/house-republican-crypto-subcommittee-165521735.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c6a2d9e7-14f4-45d9-bc99-69a675eca4b1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 16:55:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1673628922</ingested><modified>2023-01-13T16:55:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/09d7d480-935b-11ed-aedf-c26c4d0c0c7f" width="7670" height="5114" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/09d7d480-935b-11ed-aedf-c26c4d0c0c7f" width="7670" height="5114" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tom Williams via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UNITED STATES - JANUARY 6: Rep.

However, that doesn't make the process of sifting through the dozens of choices any easier. So I set out to test out some of the most popular models in different price ranges. Most of the speakers I tried sounded good on first listen; it was only through side-by-side comparisons that I began to suss out the nuances. Just reading the spec sheets only goes so far. As such, we’re focusing a bit more on audio quality and dynamic range, while also taking into consideration other factors like utility and price. Ultimately, there isn't one best portable Bluetooth speaker out there, but we've found plenty of good options that will fit a range of use cases and price points.</p><h2><strong>What to consider</strong></h2><h3>Weather-proofing</h3><p><a href="https://www.iec.ch/ip-ratings">IP ratings</a> (Ingress Protection) are the alphanumeric indicators you often see in a product’s spec sheet that define the tested resistance of a product to both solid objects (dirt, dust, fingers?) and water. It’s usually a combo of two numbers with the first indicating solid object ingress and the second being water. The former goes from 0 (no protection) to 6 (dust tight). The waterproof rating goes from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected against immersion and high pressure jets). When an X is used instead of a number, that means the product wasn’t tested for resistance. If it’s waterproof, it may have some innate resistance to solids, but there’s no guarantee.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>IP67 is a common rating these days indicating highly resistant and potentially rugged speakers. These are safe for quick dunks in the pool or tub and should be more than OK in the rain or in the shower. They’re also good options for the beach, playground and other rough environs.</p><p>Additionally, speakers with ports <em>and</em> a high rating will often include a tight-fitting cover over the charging or auxiliary ports. If you plan on using the ports, that may limit the product's rated ability to fend off the elements.</p><p>Consider the IP rating and also how you plan to use your Bluetooth speaker when making your decision. It may be worth splurging on a better sounding model with a lower IP rating if you’ll mostly be using it indoors, for instance.</p><h3>Battery life</h3><p>The focus of this guide is on portable Bluetooth speakers, and while “portable” can be a relative term, these devices are generally for people who are likely to find themselves far from a power outlet. These days, around 12 hours of runtime seems to be the baseline but obviously, the more battery life you can get out of a speaker, the better.</p><p>That said, be careful when looking at battery specs, as they frequently list a maximum runtime (“up to” x amount of hours). This usually means they tested at a low to mid volume. If you like your tunes loud, it can often end up cutting the expected usage time in half or more. Luckily, some manufacturers also list the expected battery life when used at full volume and that transparency is appreciated.</p><p>Additionally, if your Bluetooth speaker also happens to have WiFi connectivity, they're usually designed for always-on functionality. Unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that go to sleep after a short period without use, these will usually stay awake (to listen for your commands) and slowly run down the battery. If you're out and about, you'll want to remember to turn these speakers off manually when not in use to maximize battery life.</p><h3>Range</h3><p>Bluetooth range is tricky business. Some companies list their product’s longest possible range, usually outdoors and in an unobstructed line-of-sight test environment. Other companies stick with a 30-foot range on the spec sheet and leave it at that, even though they may be running Bluetooth 4.x or 5.x. That’s likely underselling the speaker's potential, but unpredictable environments can affect range and there’s little point in promising the moon only to get complaints.</p><p>I’ve seen signal drop issues when crouching down, with my phone in the front pocket of my jeans, and barely 30 feet away from a speaker inside my apartment. I ran into this issue across several devices regardless of their listed Bluetooth connectivity range.</p><p>If you’re hosting a patio party and duck inside, it’s wise to have the source device remain close by just in case. It’s hard to gauge what aspects of any environment may interfere with a Bluetooth signal. In general, take range specs around 100 feet or more as a perfect-world scenario.</p><h3>Latency</h3><p>This is a minor mention for those out there who use a speaker for their computer output, or as a mini soundbar solution for setups like a monitor and streaming box. It’s annoying to find that your speaker’s latency isn’t low enough to avoid lip sync issues. Luckily, it seems that <em>most</em> speakers these days don’t often have these problems. Only a handful of the few dozen speakers I tried had persistent, noticeable lip-sync issues. Aside from occasional blips, all of our picks worked well in this regard.</p><p>If you plan to frequently use a speaker for video playback, look for devices with the most recent Bluetooth versions (4.x or 5.x) and lower latency codecs like aptX. Also make sure the speaker is close to the source device as distance can be a factor. To avoid the issue altogether, though, consider getting one with a wired auxiliary input.</p><h2><strong>Price: $50 to $200</strong></h2><h3>Tribit StormBox Micro 2 ($60)</h3><p><core-commerce id="59342dcbd97b433eb4b0cea2601d2269" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.3<br><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 12 hours<br><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IP67<br><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> N/A<br><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 70Hz - 20kHz<br><strong>App:</strong> No</p><p>If you’re just looking for an ultra-portable speaker that can kick out some decent volume, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UcmliaXQtU3Rvcm1Cb3gtUG9ydGFibGUtU3BlYWtlci1CdWlsdC9kcC9CMDlRNTkzMjFOLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1meC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWJkM2EwYmQtN2NhMS00NTRiLWI0Y2QtM2FmYTU1ZDUxODUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfuFzh0yGiZ9XlC2zXyydFGwoNIdOpGopFvwCXvWnSvl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTribit-StormBox-Portable-Speaker-Built%2Fdp%2FB09Q59321N%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:">Tribit StormBox Micro 2</a> fits the bill.

The rubbery rear strap works well on relatively thin things like belts, backpacks and bike handlebars.</p><p>While it’s small and affordable, the speaker doubles as a USB-C powerbank to charge your devices in a pinch and you can wirelessly connect two of them for party mode or stereo sound.

It’s still a cute, barrel-shaped speaker with a nubby little strap that probably needs a carabiner to help attach it to most things. But this refreshed model includes a couple of bright new colors, an extra hour of battery life and improved wireless range. With an IP67 rating on top of the company’s five-foot drop test durability, it can go with you almost anywhere and survive to tell the tale.</p><p>The audio quality is punchy and bright enough for what you’d expect at this scale and price range. Although there’s no app support or connectivity with the rest of the Ultimate Ears speaker lineup, you can easily pair it with a second Wonderboom for stereo sound. There’s also an outdoor mode button on the bottom that boosts the mid and high range to help the audio carry over a greater distance.</p><h3>Soundcore Motion+  ($107)</h3><p><core-commerce id="2e6fb4f492d94edeb7053651d4479f22" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.0<br><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 12 hours<br><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IPX7<br><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> 3.5mm<br><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 50Hz - 40kHz<br><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>This nondescript wedge of a wireless <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Bbmtlci1Tb3VuZGNvcmUtQmx1ZXRvb3RoLUN1c3RvbWl6YWJsZS1XYXRlcnByb29mL2RwL0IwN1AzOU1MS0g_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZngtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFiZDNhMGJkLTdjYTEtNDU0Yi1iNGNkLTNhZmE1NWQ1MTg1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb-0WsULqYGKiDsej66iyhZ6CEPaodgeQvSYLBftNnhm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-Customizable-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB07P39MLKH" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:">speaker</a> could easily slip under your radar, but it’s worth a listen.

If you have two of these, they can pair for stereo sound, or connect 100 or more Trance Go speakers via the app’s PartyCast feature.</p><h3>JBL Flip 6 ($130)</h3><p><core-commerce id="14990fc7abe94758b0870f3ba81461fc" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.1<br><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 12 hours<br><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IP67<br><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> N/A<br><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 63Hz - 20kHz<br><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9KQkwtRmxpcC1CbHVldG9vdGgtV2F0ZXJwcm9vZi1QYXJ0eUJvb3N0L2RwL0IwOUdKWktRM0s_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZngtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFiZDNhMGJkLTdjYTEtNDU0Yi1iNGNkLTNhZmE1NWQ1MTg1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASoM7mRPXRXrD01-c5o1Tx570LFKhF40cXB_d-uemYNM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJBL-Flip-Bluetooth-Waterproof-PartyBoost%2Fdp%2FB09GJZKQ3K" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:">JBL’s Flip 6</a> deserves high marks for overall sound quality, durability and volume considering its size. As with most JBL speakers, it has a good dynamic range from solid lows to crisp highs with volume tipped towards higher registers. The cylindrical shape works well on its side or even standing on its end to save desk space. It has a capable carrying (or hanging) strap and raised buttons you can discern in the dark.</p><p>The JBL Portable app gives you a 3-band EQ to customize the sound profile if desired and if you have two Flip 6 speakers, you can run them in stereo mode.

While it’s still not a room filler, the speaker offers some bright, dynamic finesse to your tunes, along with a significant amount of bass for its size. It’s similar to the scale of a small clutch bag, with a very small strap for carabiner-type hanging. Much of the exterior is sheathed in soft-touch silicone, except for the powder-coated steel speaker grilles. Like others in this range, the speaker is IP67 rated so it can handle the elements and sound good doing it.</p><p>Setup and connecting to the speaker should be done from within the aptly named Bose Connect app. You can also turn off voice prompts (which can become annoying) and pair with similar speakers for either party mode or stereo.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Some users running Android 12 may encounter connectivity issues with the Bose Connect app. The company is working to resolve the problem.</p><h3>Marshall Emberton II ($170)</h3><p><core-commerce id="b0644be326724fba81d9d5b58d617f67" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.2<br><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 30 hours<br><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IP67<br><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> N/A<br><strong>Frequency range: </strong>60Hz - 20kHz<br><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>The recently released <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVhYVzU0UUc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZngtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFiZDNhMGJkLTdjYTEtNDU0Yi1iNGNkLTNhZmE1NWQ1MTg1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfht1mOcUah63SrjSE5gUvdTQfgdSweWQDM12-DRPT7P&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09XXW54QG" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:">Emberton II</a> Bluetooth portable from Marshall has a bumped up set of specs that make it a better value than the previous gen. This clutchable rectangular slab still has a pair of 10-watt full-range drivers and passive radiators to deliver the brand’s signature sound. It may not be the loudest in its size range, but it focuses more on balanced output than raw power. There’s still 360 sound as well, making it a good companion for small get togethers. Although, with its 60hz low end threshold, you’ll find a better bass response when there are surfaces to reflect off of, and not so much if it’s in the middle of a table.</p><p>This new model now offers up to 30 hours of listening on a charge (10 hours better than before) and  a more rugged IP67 rating. There’s also a new ability to pair with another Emberton II or Willen II using the new “Stack Mode”. The range between them is limited, however, so stacking them probably <em>is</em> the best way to go. Additionally, Marshall is offering a more environmentally friendly product than before, using 50 percent post-consumer plastics in its construction.</p><h3>JBL Charge 5 ($180)</h3><p><core-commerce id="c6c17a92051446edb7be99c2b492b2c1" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.1<br><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 20 hours<br><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IP67<br><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> N/A<br><strong>Frequency range: </strong>60Hz - 20kHz<br><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>If you’re willing to spend a little more for bigger sound, longer battery life and a USB-C port to charge your devices, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9KQkwtQ0hBUkdFLVBvcnRhYmxlLUJsdWV0b290aC1XYXRlcnByb29mL2RwL0IwOFg0WU1UUE0_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZngtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFiZDNhMGJkLTdjYTEtNDU0Yi1iNGNkLTNhZmE1NWQ1MTg1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZQ58LSE-PLozjnqWz1dLmSYlkssv4_F1vvK-usdh55Y&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJBL-CHARGE-Portable-Bluetooth-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB08X4YMTPM" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:">JBL Charge 5</a> is a great upgrade over the Flip 6.

There’s a 5.25-inch concave aluminum cone woofer, two 1-inch silk dome tweeters and a rear bass reflex port.</p><p>The SoundStage 3 has a battery life of up to 10 hours with the volume at 50 percent, which is fine, but not spectacular. However, it also operates at full volume when plugged in and charging. You can also top up your devices with the USB charging port drawing from its 8800mAh battery. The other output port is a single RCA for mono analog subwoofer support, although it does well in the bass category on its own. As for inputs, there are a few: a 3.5mm stereo jack, RCA stereo and a digital optical S/PDIF.</p><p>Monoprice is known for affordable, no-nonsense devices with a good deal of utility.

It has a well-rounded low end and a bright dynamic sound with plenty of nuance that makes for a great listening experience.</p><p>This 360-degree portable comes as a combo WiFi/Bluetooth speaker primarily geared toward smart home use with the occasional outing.

While it may appear as rugged as concert gear, it’s less impervious to the elements as some with just an IPX2 rating, so it’s protected from light splashes from above.</p><p>Whether or not you’re a fan of the brand, the rich and distinctly thumping output may make you one. We felt pulled into the sound while listening to the Tufton, a bit more than most other speakers we tested at this scale. It’s dynamic, warm and, dare we say, analog in its audio presence. It’s also multi-directional with a supplemental driver on the back along with a bass port.</p><p>There’s no app to adjust the EQ, just the physical controls including a Bluetooth connect button, a power/volume knob and two for bass and treble. Once powered on, you can use the volume knob to set a max headroom and adjust volume on the fly from your source. The bass and treble knobs help you choose the tone of your adventure, from a purely flat soundscape to an enhanced one. We just wish you could see the dial indicators in the dark. Other features include aptX support and quick-charge capabilities that provide four hours of listening time in just 20 minutes, plus great standby battery life.</p><h2><strong>Price: $450 and higher</strong></h2><h3>JBL Boombox 3 ($500)</h3><p><core-commerce id="3d53d17f1472443d9fdf4fa5bd99dc6a" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.3<br><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 24 hours<br><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IPX7<br><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> 3.5mm<br><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 40Hz - 20kHz<br><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>If you’re a fan of JBL’s smaller portables, but want to kick the volume up several degrees higher, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVlEUzhCSEs_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZngtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFiZDNhMGJkLTdjYTEtNDU0Yi1iNGNkLTNhZmE1NWQ1MTg1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZpZJ5RN0EU4dauV-xJCkqxuAuWxZlqA1jluZeUyCyf5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09YDS8BHK" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:">Boombox 3</a> is a good choice. This 160-watt-plus big brother to the Xtreme 3 provides that familiar JBL sound but, you know, louder. The output has bright and dynamic highs and floor shaking sub-bass that may benefit more from an indoor environment with surfaces to bounce off. It doesn’t have the long throw that “loudspeakers” have, although to be clear, it is pretty loud. This is a dance party tool for your basement rumpus room, garage hangout, beach or poolside craziness.</p><p>The Boombox 3 has a few upgrades from the previous gen. The exterior looks mostly the same, but it’s now IP67 rated making it very rugged. It’s also a touch heavier at 14.7 pounds, possibly since this device now has a woofer alongside the mids and tweeters.</p><p>It’s still a convenient grab-and-go speaker for most occasions when you want the music to be the star of the show (or at least not disappear into the background). The battery can keep you playing for up to 24 hours, but it also runs at full volume while plugged in. In fact, while it’s connected to an outlet, the total output wattage gets a boost from 160 watts to 180 watts.</p><h3>Sony SRS-XP700 ($548)</h3><p><core-commerce id="cd16262743454b4ca679d1e717af5cee" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.0<br><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 20 hours<br><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IPX4<br><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> 3.5mm, USB thumb drive listening, Guitar, Mic<br><strong>Frequency range:</strong> N/A<br><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>Sony’s big <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVBvcnRhYmxlLUJsdWV0b290aC1LYXJhb2tlLVBhcnR5LVNwZWFrZXItU3BsYXNoLVJlc2lzdGFudC1Ib3VyLUJhdHRlcnkvZHAvQjA5NFQ5OVY2Mz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1meC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWJkM2EwYmQtN2NhMS00NTRiLWI0Y2QtM2FmYTU1ZDUxODUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdy6iMeOziUFDec3PsldvU2pdcJfYoVrxHmthKZk8dHR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-Portable-Bluetooth-Karaoke-Party-Speaker-Splash-Resistant-Hour-Battery%2Fdp%2FB094T99V63" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:">SRS-XP700 Bluetooth speaker</a> is a good option for fans of loud, thumping beats. The unit has the look of a futuristic stereo speaker at 2.25 feet tall and about 37 pounds, with pleasing lighting effects on the inside of both top and bottom grab bars. You’ll also find USB charging ports and LDAC support, while the app offers customization including light controls.</p><p>The XP700 remains portable enough for many people to shuffle around locally without <em>too</em> much effort and its IPX4 rating means it can handle spills and splashes. The exterior is hard plastic with some rubberized feet, but it’s not the type of speaker you want to treat carelessly. It’s mostly a homebody that can fire up parties in lofts, garages, basements or backyards. You can also wirelessly pair two for a more powerful experience.</p><p>While the sound is big and bassy, it comes up short on handling the lowest registers well. Also, the high end isn’t as pronounced as it could be, so it may not be for everyone. It’s more of a loudspeaker style, so it's better in bigger rooms and shines at louder volumes.</p><h3>Soundboks Go ($699)</h3><p><core-commerce id="a0731d1938ed48e3ada7e9b7392dcdc8" data-type="product-list"></core-commerce></p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 5.0<br><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 40 hours<br><strong>IP Rating:</strong> IP65<br><strong>Aux inputs:</strong> 3.5mm<br><strong>Frequency range:</strong> 40Hz - 20kHz<br><strong>App:</strong> Yes</p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVlSTVJHS1Y_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZngtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFiZDNhMGJkLTdjYTEtNDU0Yi1iNGNkLTNhZmE1NWQ1MTg1MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVR6IRJRQbNa62mA9zIUHt7c2_oKphMrHKHo9U5-R4d1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09YRMRGKV" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:">Soundboks Go</a> is a top performer if you’re looking for a portable Bluetooth option that provides a big sound for larger spaces, although it comes at a price. This unpretentious black rectangle is half the size of its more professional sibling the Soundboks Gen 3. It packs one 10-inch woofer and a 1-inch domed tweeter, both powered by two 72W RMS amps for massive sound and chunky bass, even at a distance.</p><p>At 20 pounds, it’s fairly easy to lug around and looks about the size of carry-on luggage. You can even get the optional shoulder strap, which helps for longer missions. It has a flexible TPE handle on top, silicone bumpers around the edges and ABS+Polycarbonate exterior and grill. The IP65 rating also marks it as a resilient device in most environments.</p><p>The sound makes a big statement here. Output levels are rated at up to 121dB, with clear mids and highs projecting clearly across large areas. The low end also has a significant presence at a distance, matching up with 40Hz frequency response. It's definitely capable enough to support large gatherings.</p><p>The speaker is easy to connect to via Bluetooth and the partner app offers EQ customization, audio profiles and OTA firmware updates. There’s a solitary 3.5mm stereo input on the Go, but its wireless expansion shines, letting you connect up to five Soundboks Gen 3 or Go speakers at the touch of a button with its built-in SKAA wireless support.</p><p>Lastly, the battery pack is removable, swappable and also long-lasting for a speaker this size; at low to mid volume, it’s rated at up to 40 hours runtime. For transparency, Soundboks also lets you know to expect around 10 hours of play at full volume. You <em>can</em> also run this while charging, but there are strict warnings about keeping the volume low while doing so (it’s not recommended unless you're desperate).</p><h3></h3>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1bd3a0bd-7ca1-454b-b4cd-3afa55d51850</guid><dc:creator>Jon Turi</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 14:30:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1673621131</ingested><modified>2023-01-13T14:45:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Turi]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/85e08920-b759-11ec-beb9-015235c0a851" width="2500" height="1615" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/85e08920-b759-11ec-beb9-015235c0a851" width="2500" height="1615" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jon Turi / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A group of portable Bluetooth speakers in front of a shelf full of books and stuff.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Portable Bluetooth speakers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: Why is air travel falling apart?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The IT Crowd was right!

A Hummer EV is over 9,000lbs, the board leader said, while electrified versions of vehicles like the Ford F-150 and Volvo XC40 are far heavier than their gas engine equivalents.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ntsb-chair-says-evs-too-big-and-heavy-143100532.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-disgraced-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-started-a-newsletter-121524221.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">21e29c22-5db5-41e9-b28f-29d5dfae595f</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 12:15:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1673611530</ingested><modified>2023-01-13T12:05:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/4dbb1a20-8b9c-11ed-bfff-098e3d3d682d" width="5500" height="3667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/4dbb1a20-8b9c-11ed-bfff-098e3d3d682d" width="5500" height="3667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Dee Delgado / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Former FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces fraud charges over the collapse of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, arrives on the day of a hearing at Manhattan federal court in New York City, U.S. January 3, 2023.

The least expensive EV, the Model 3 RWD, has dropped from $46,990 to $43,990, while the 5-seat Model Y Long Range fell 20 percent from $65,990 to $52,990. That means the latter model now qualifies for the $7,500 US Federal Tax credit, so the final price drop will be $20,500 — over 30 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>All other models, including the Model S and Model X (both regular and plaid versions) and the performance versions of the Model 3 and Model Y saw price cuts. However, the 7-seat option on the Model Y has increased in price by $1,000 to $4,000. While that puts the price over $55,000, it still qualifies for the Tax Credit as it&#39;s considered to be an SUV. In Germany, Model 3 and Y prices were cut by one to 17 percent, and also dropped in Austria, Switzerland and France.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To receive the full $7,500 rebate, customers will have to order before mid-March, when it&#39;s expected to be reduced to half that. The tax rebates apply to SUVs priced below $80,000 and cars under $55,000. The Model Y fell into both categories, depending on the number of seats, meaning certain 5-seat models <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teslas-long-range-model-y-may-not-qualify-for-the-ev-tax-credit-101229812.html">weren&#39;t eligible</a> — something CEO Elon Musk called &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1610311411137384449">messed up</a>.&quot; Now, all Model Y EVs except the Performance version appear to qualify.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Late last year, it was reported that Tesla inventory was building up after years of strong sales, first with reports<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-shanghai-adds-inventory-highest-rate-ever-october-brokerage-data-2022-11-09/"> in Chin</a>a, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-tesla-slash-prices-inventory-investors-2022-12?r=US&amp;IR=T">then the US</a>. Tesla recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-cuts-prices-model-3-model-y-china-2023-01-06/">cut prices</a> in China, then later <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/10/tesla-shuts-down-protesters-no-compensation-for-price-drop/">declined</a> any compensation to customers who complained. The Model 3 now starts at 229,900 yuan ($33,425) in that nation.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither Tesla nor CEO Elon Musk have weighed in on the price cuts, but potential buyers will no doubt be pleased (and recent purchasers displeased). The Model 3 was originally supposed to cost $35,000 and shipped in that configuration for a short time, but saw steady increases to the $46,990 price <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-raises-prices-across-entire-ev-lineup-101002343.html">announced in March 2022</a>.

Apparently, during the tech giant&#39;s annual advisory meeting for shareholders in 2022, only 64 percent of the &quot;Say on Pay&quot; votes cast regarding the compensation proposals for executives was in favor of retaining their 2021 pay packages. While that&#39;s still majority of the votes, it represents a significant year-over-year decline in approval. As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/12/tim-cook-pay-cut-earnings/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> notes, 94.9 percent of the shareholders who voted the previous year was in favor of the compensation proposals for executives.&nbsp;</p><p>To decide this year&#39;s pay packages, Apple&#39;s Compensation Committee took into account the Say on Pay&#39;s voting results and Tim Cook&#39;s own recommendation &quot;to adjust his compensation in light of feedback received.&quot; For 2023, Cook&#39;s target salary is $49 million, down $35 million from his target salary in 2022. His base pay is still $3 million and his annual cash incentive remains unchanged at $6 million, but his equity award value went from $75 million in 2022 to $40 million this year. Further, he was granted an equity award that&#39;s 75 percent performance and 25 percent time-based vesting, instead of 50-50 like 2022&#39;s.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The truth is that Cook, who vowed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-27-tim-cook-charity.html">donate his fortune to charity</a> a few years ago, will likely earn more than $49 million this year due to stock awards and bonuses. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-12/apple-s-cook-to-take-pay-cut-in-2023-that-it-says-he-requested?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, he earned $99.4 million in 2022, which was $15.4 million more than his target salary for the year. In 2021, his total pay package was $98.7 million. Critics like advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services previously <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-shareholder-iss-urges-vote-against-ceo-cooks-bonus-2022-02-16/">urged shareholders</a> to vote against Cook&#39;s pay package, citing concerns about how big his equity award is and how it&#39;s structured. &quot;Half of the award lacks performance criteria,&quot; the firm previously said. This shift in Cook&#39;s compensation reflects the changing attitude towards executive pay, and the CEO might be setting an example for his peers. It is, after all, uncommon for an executive his level to recommend that their own pay be cut.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-taking-a-40-percent-pay-cut-2023-065514262.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">56ee6b94-0f12-4e68-99ae-96cdbd73a6e9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 06:55:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1673616005</ingested><modified>2023-01-13T13:20:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/ea69e0e0-9344-11ed-bfce-7252c032292b" width="5500" height="3669" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/ea69e0e0-9344-11ed-bfce-7252c032292b" width="5500" height="3669" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[REUTERS/Andrew Kelly]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook visits the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14 range in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., September 16, 2022.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[APPLE-IPHONE/USA Tim Cook]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
